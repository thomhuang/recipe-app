# recipe-app
With the unexpected lockdown, many people are sure to have started cooking themselves, so we decided to create this app to make home cooksâ€™ lives easier in the kitchen. Often times, home cooks have trouble finding recipes, not to mention those that work with what they have in their pantry and this hopefully solves this issue. Thus, our app works to retrieve data from www.SeriousEats.com and utilize the information to query recipes containing specific ingredients directly to the user.
