## Abstract
With the unexpected lockdown, many people are sure to have started cooking themselves, so we decided to create this app to make home cooks’ lives easier in the kitchen. Often times, home cooks have trouble finding recipes, not to mention those that work with what they have in their pantry and this hopefully solves this issue. Thus, our app works to retrieve data from www.SeriousEats.com and utilize the information to query recipes containing specific ingredients directly to the user. 

## Planned Deliverables

As stated in the abstract, we will work to web scrape website(s) such as www.SeriousEats.com to obtain recipe data. With this information, we will be able to create an application that utilizes this information and display the user with recipes that use ingredients they have on hand.
A partial success of our project would entail getting the bare necessities in terms of the features done. So, for example
·         web-scraping all recipes from the website(s) successfully and completely
·         manipulating and cleaning the data to be readable/clear in its contents
·          After a user inputs a list of their ingredients at hand, they get back an easy to view list of recipes that correspond to it
·         Any form of a user-interface OR a repository that provides all necessary algorithms/data needed to make it a user interface.
A full success of our project would of course do everything our partial success would have, but also allow us to:
·         query recipes from specific authors
·         query under a specific category
·         unit conversions
·         additional notes within the recipe 
·         recipe suggestions from given ingredients

## Resources Required

We practically will not need to obtain resources other than the websites that we take the data from. From the website(s) that we are choosing, they will all be free to access and public so there will not be any problems with obtaining data legally and fairly.


## Tools/Skills Required

Broadly, we will need to be able to web-scrape websites, work with data frames and databases, as well as potentially a GUI
Potential packages we’d use are: Scrapy, Pandas, SQLite 3, NumPy, sklearn
