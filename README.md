# recipe-app
With the unexpected lockdown, many people are sure to have started cooking themselves, so we decided to create this app to make home cooks’ lives easier in the kitchen. Often times, home cooks have trouble finding recipes, not to mention those that work with what they have in their pantry and this hopefully solves this issue. Thus, our app works to retrieve data from www.SeriousEats.com and utilize the information to query recipes containing specific ingredients directly to the user. 

## Abstract

## Planned Deliverables

## Resources Required

## Tools/Skills Required

## Risks:
There are a few things that could potentially stop us from achieving our full deliverables. For instance, the querying for recipes could be too slow for an enjoyable user experience, or our data taken from the website is unusable. 

## Ethics:
With our specific project, there shouldn’t be any particular ethical issues. With the scope of our project, the techniques used such as web-scraping and compiling data COULD be unethical, we are only taking information that is shown publicly on the websites that contain no personal data, etc.

## Timeline:
Week 2 : By the end of week two, we should have web-scraped all the information we need from the websites.
Week 4: We should have manipulated and cleaned the data so that it is actually parseable and readable. 
Week 6: We’ll work on matching the user’s input to the data values, and if time permits we could make a user interface to compliment the functionality.
