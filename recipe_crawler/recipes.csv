The Food Lab's All-American Meatloaf Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,"1/2 cup,homemade,or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock,1/4 cup buttermilk,1/2 ounce (2 packets; about 1 1/2 tablespoons) unflavored gelatin,2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, crusts removed and torn into rough pieces,4 ounces button or cremini mushrooms, cleaned,3 anchovy filets,1/2 teaspoon Marmite,2 teaspoons soy sauce,1 teaspoon paprika,2 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped (about 2 teaspoons),1 small onion, roughly chopped (about 3/4 cup),1 small carrot, peeled and roughly (about 1/2 cup),1 stalk celery, roughly chopped (about 1/2 cup),2 tablespoons unsalted butter,12 ounces freshly ground pork (see note),1 1/4 pounds freshly ground beef (see note),2 large eggs,4 ounces cheddar, provolone, Monterey Jack, or Muenster cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup),1/4 cup finely minced fresh parsley,Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper,,For the Glaze:,,3/4 cup ketchup,1/4 cup packed light brown sugar,1/2 cup cider vinegar,1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","Combine the chicken stock and buttermilk in a liquid measuring cup and sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the top. Set aside.Place the bread and mushrooms in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.Add the anchovies, Marmite, soy sauce, paprika, and garlic to the processor bowl and pulse until reduced to a fine paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and pulse until finely chopped but not pureed.Heat the butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the chopped vegetable mixture and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until it is softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes; the mixture should start to darken a bit. Stir in the buttermilk mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms and bread, stir thoroughly to combine, and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.Add the meat mixture to the bowl, along with the eggs, cheese, parsley, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. With clean hands, mix gently until everything is thoroughly combined and homogeneous; it will be fairly loose. Pull off a teaspoon-sized portion of the mixture, place it on a microwave-safe plate, and microwave it on high power until cooked through, about 15 seconds. Taste the cooked piece for seasoning and add more salt and/or pepper as desired.Transfer the mixture to a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, being sure that no air bubbles get trapped underneath. (You may have some extra mix, depending on the capacity of your pan; this can be cooked in a ramekin or free-form next to the loaf.) Tear off a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil large enough to line a rimmed baking sheet and use it to tightly cover the meatloaf, crimping it around the edges of the pan. Refrigerate the meatloaf while the oven preheats. (The meatloaf can be refriger- ated for up to 2 days.)Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F. When the oven is hot, remove the meatloaf from the refrigerator and, without removing the foil cover, carefully invert it onto the rimmed baking sheet. Loosen the foil and spread it out, leaving the pan on top of the meatloaf (see note). Fold up the edges of the foil to trap the liquid that escapes from the meatloaf while baking. Bake until just beginning to set (the top should feel firm to the touch), about 30 minutes.Use a thin metal spatula to lift an edge of the inverted loaf pan, jiggling it until it slides off the meatloaf easily, and use oven mitts or a folded kitchen towel to remove the pan, leaving the meatloaf on the center of the foil. Return to the oven and bake until the center of the meatloaf registers 140°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes longer. There will be quite a bit of exuded juices; this is OK. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 500°F.Meanwhile, Make the Glaze:Combine the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, and pepper in a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is homogeneous, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.Use a brush to apply some glaze to the meatloaf in a thin, even layer, then return it to the oven and bake for 3 minutes. Glaze again and bake for 3 minutes longer. Glaze one more time and bake until the glaze is beginning to bubble and is a deep burnished brown, about 4 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice and serve with any extra glaze and mustard or ketchup as desired.The Food Lab: The Best Meatloaf","American,Roasted Beef,Ground Beef,Pork,Beef Mains"

Transfer 1/2 cup (120ml) marinade to a separate vessel and set aside.For the Steak:Place steaks in a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and add remaining marinade. Seal bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Massage bag until meat is fully coated in marinade. Lay flat in refrigerator, turning every couple of hours, for at least 3 and up to 10 hours.For the Fajitas:When ready to cook, preheat broiler and position over rack to highest position. If you have a baking steel or stone, set iton the top rack and allow to preheat. If using a baking steel/stone, set a rimmed baking sheet on it to preheat as well; otherwise leave the baking sheet at room temperature.Remove steaks from marinade and blot dry with paper towels. Arrange steaks in an even layer on rimmed baking sheet. Broil, without flipping, until steaks are well charred on top side, about 4 minutes. Broiler strength and oven designs vary greatly, so cooking times will vary as well; keep a close watch. If your broiler heats unevenly, you may need to move the sheet tray around for more even browning. If not using a baking steel or stone, flip steaks and broil for 30 seconds longer (steaks cooked with the help of a baking steel/stone do not need to be flipped and cooked longer). Remove from oven and transfer steaks to a platter to rest.Switch oven from broil mode to 450°F (230°C). Add red, yellow, and green bell peppers as well as onions to baking sheet. Pour reserved 1/2 cup of marinade all over and toss until evenly coated; using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits on the baking sheet. Arrange peppers and onion in an even layer that covers the baking sheet from edge to edge, then cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and browned in spots, about 25 minutes (if your oven heats from the top, you will want to cook the vegetables on a middle rack to avoid excessive scorching and burning). If you're using a baking steel/stone, you can cook the vegetables on it, but keep a closer eye since they run the risk of scorching on the bottom; if this begins to happen, move the sheet pan to another rack.Slice steak into thin strips across the grain; then add back to sheet pan with any juices. Return to oven to warm through; if steaks need additional cooking, leave them an additional minute or two until they've reached the desired doneness.Serve immediately with hot tortillas, guacamole,pico de gallo, and other condiments, as desired.How to Build a Sheet-Pan Dinner","Skirt Steaks,Southwestern & Tex Mex,Roasted Beef,Beef Mains,Game Day"

These flaps will be essential in removing the ""ice cream"" later on; wax paper and tinfoil should not be used.Prepare a water bath in a wide pot, with a thick ring of crumpled tinfoil set inside to later prevent the bowl from touching the bottom of the pot or the water itself. Place pot over high heat until water is bubbling-hot, then adjust to maintain a gentle simmer.For the Filling:Combine egg whites, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place bowl over the water bath so it sits on the foil ring (the bowl should not touch the water). Cook, stirring and scraping continuously with a flexible spatula, until egg white mixture reaches 165°F (74°C). This should take about 6 minutes in a metal bowl; if it takes substantially longer, it simply means the heat is too low. If the mixture cooks too fast, or scrambles despite constant stirring, this indicates that the water has come to a boil, or that the water is able to touch the bowl.When the mixture reaches 165°F, transfer bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed until meringue is glossy, stiff, and thick, about 5 minutes. (The timing will vary depending on the power of a given stand mixer.)Once meringue is thick and stiff, whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks, as well. (This can be done in a separate bowl by hand or with a hand mixer, or in the original stand mixer bowl if the meringue is transferred to a second bowl; no need to wash the whisk.) Add milk and vanilla to meringue and whisk to combine. Add whipped cream and continue whisking until smooth.Immediately pour ""ice cream"" mixture into prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Cover with foil (the foil should not touch the ice cream) and freeze overnight or until 0°F (-18°C). Meanwhile, freeze a cutting board large enough to accommodate the pan as well.Using the excess parchment, tug the chilled ice cream from the pan. Remove one sheet of parchment and place over the surface of the ice cream, then invert ice cream onto the chilled cutting board. Peel off remaining parchment and cut ice cream into 9 squares with a largechef's knife, wiping the blade clean with a paper towel between slices. Drape with a sheet of plastic wrap and return ice cream bars to the freezer until needed. (If this will be longer than 1 hour, be sure to wrap the bars tightly in plastic to prevent odor absorption.)For the Chocolate Coating:Melt chocolate over a water bath or in a microwave-safe bowl, using two or three 15-second bursts on normal power and stirring well between rounds. Add coconut oil and stir until fully melted and smooth. If any lumps refuse to melt, rewarm briefly and stir until they do. Pour approximately two-thirds of this mixture into a bowl or container approximately 4 1/2 inches wide and 2 1/2 inches deep (see note), and cool to about 80°F (27°C). The time needed for this stage will vary depending on the starting temperature of the coconut oil and melted chocolate.To Assemble the Bars:When the chocolate has cooled, grab an extra sheet of parchment and remove prepared ice cream bars from freezer. Working with one at a time, use an offset spatula to loosen each bar and transfer to the dish of chocolate coating. Using a fork, dunk each portion under the chocolate, then lift and allow the excess to run off. Transfer to a clean sheet of parchment set on the free edge of the cutting board. This setup will work something like a conveyor belt, as the dipped bars slowly outnumber the un-dipped bars and take up new space on the chilled board.Continue until all bars have been coated, adding reserved chocolate to dipping bowl as needed. Pause as needed throughout the process to re-freeze the bars if they seem to be melting or softening around the edges.Freeze the bars until the chocolate coating has fully set, about 15 minutes, then transfer to a gallon-sized, freezer-safe zip-top bag. If you like, the individual bars can be wrapped in a sheet of wax paper or thindecorative foil. Continue freezing until ice cream has fully hardened after its time outside the freezer, about 4 hours more. In an airtight container, the ice cream bars can be kept in the freezer for up to 1 month.WhatWouldn’tYou Do for a Homemade Klondike Bar?","Ice Cream,American,Gluten-free Desserts,Chocolate"
Classic Pecan Pie Recipe,Lauren Weisenthal,",One half recipe Easy Pie Dough,,3 eggs, beaten,2 tablespoons honey,1 cup light corn syrup,1/4 cup brown sugar,4 tablespoons melted butter, cooled,1/2 teaspoon salt,1 teaspoon vanilla,3 cups toasted pecans (2 cups roughly chopped and 1 cup left whole)","Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.Roll pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges.In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, salt, and vanilla. Whisk for approximately 30 seconds, until the mixture is homogenous and slightly frothy.Keep whisking until the mixture is homogenous and a little bit frothy. This will help incorporate air into it so that the filling strikes a balance between gooey and light..Line pie crust with chopped pecans, reserving the whole ones. Press down slightly so chopped pecans embed in the dough. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, then gently place the whole pecans in concentric circles on the top, taking care not to press too hard, which will cause the nuts to sink into the filling.Bake pie for 40 minutes, rotating half way through baking. Continue baking, shielding the exposed nuts with aluminum foil if they threaten to burn. When finished, the filling should by slightly jiggly, but mostly set and puffed slightly, about 1 hour total. Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight before serving.The unfolded foil should fit perfectly over the pecans. Bake the pecan pie in a preheated 375°F oven for a total of 1 hour, checking it halfway through.

Deep-Fried Potato Skins With Crème Fraîche and Smoked Salmon Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,"5 Yukon Gold potatoes, ideally about 5 or 6 ounces (140 to 170g) each (though larger potatoes will also work),Vegetable or canola oil, for greasing the potatoes and deep-frying,Kosher salt,Crème fraîche (or sour cream),4 ounces (115g) thinly sliced smoked salmon,Dill sprigs, for garnish","Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Rub each potato with a light coat of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until just tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Alternatively, microwave pricked and oiled potatoes until just tender, about 5 minutes.Let potatoes stand until cool enough to handle, then cut in half across their equators. Using a small spoon, scoop out most of the potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving a layer of potato flesh roughly 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick still attached to the skin. (It's okay if the layer of potato flesh attached to the skin isn't perfectly even; that unevenness can add some good textural contrast to each cup.) If you want the cups to stand up more easily, slice off the very bottom of each one to create a level base. Set potato cups aside.Using a blender or immersion blender, process scooped potato flesh into a slurry, adding just enough water to form a purée the consistency of applesauce. (You need only enough potato slurry to lightly coat each scooped potato cup, so you may want to purée only a portion of the scooped flesh and reserve the rest for a small batch ofmashed potatoes.)Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. In a 5-quart Dutch oven or large wok, heat 2 1/2 inches oil over high heat until it reaches a temperature of 365°F (185°C). Working in batches, dip each scooped potato cup in the potato slurry to coat it inside and out; allow the excess slurry to drain off, then carefully lower each potato cup into the hot oil. Because the slurry is so wet, the frying will be very vigorous, so be careful not to fry more than a few at a time.Cook, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, until potatoes just begin to turn lightly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towel–lined baking sheet, inverting each one, concave side down, to allow it to fully drain. Repeat dipping and frying with remaining potato cups. Using a fine-mesh strainer, skim out any free-floating fried bits of slurry from the oil and discard.When ready to serve, return oil in Dutch oven or wok to 365°F (185°C). Fry potato cups in batches a second time, agitating them with wire mesh spider, until deeply golden brown and crispy all over, inside and out, about 3 minutes. Transfer cups to fresh paper towels to drain and season them with salt on all sides, then turn them concave side down to fully drain.Once they are cool enough to handle, arrange cups on a plate, concave side up. Fill each with a generous dollop of crème fraîche and top with smoked salmon and a sprig of dill.

Heat a larger cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Working in batches, toast bread, butter-side down, until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer toasted bread slices to a rimmed baking sheet, toasted-side up; allow to cool slightly.Flip bread slices over, so untoasted sides are facing up. Spread Russian dressing evenly on each slice of bread. If you are finishing sandwiches on a griddle or in a skillet, layer one slice of cheese on each slice of bread. If you are finishing sandwiches in the oven, layer one slice of cheese on only four slices of bread. Divide turkey evenly over four bread slices (for oven sandwiches, use the four slices without cheese), making sure to let any excess stock drip off before arranging on bread. Divide cranberry-sauerkraut mixture evenly over turkey. Layer remaining cheese slices over cranberry-sauerkraut.If finishing sandwiches in the oven, transfer baking sheet to the oven and bake until cheese is fully melted, about 3 minutes. Close sandwiches, pressing each one together lightly. If finishing sandwiches on a griddle, close sandwiches and cook over medium heat, pressing down on sandwiches with a weight or spatula, until cheese is fully melted, about 2 minutes on each side.

White Cake With Brown Butter and Toasted Sugar Recipe,Stella Parks,"For the Cake:,21 ounces sugar (about 3 cups; 595g),12 ounces unsalted butter (about 3 sticks; 340g),2 tablespoons baking powder,1 1/4 ounces vanilla (about 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons; 35g),3/4 ounce water (about 4 1/2 teaspoons; 21g),1 tablespoon (12g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight,1/4 teaspoon baking soda,4 large eggs, brought to about 65°F/18°C (about 7 ounces; 200g),20 ounces bleached cake flour, such as,Swans Down,, see note (about 4 1/2 cups, spooned; 565g),22 ounces milk, any percentage will do (about 2 3/4 cups; 625g), brought to about 65°F/18°C,To Finish:,About 6 cups of frosting, any style","Toast the Sugar:Adjust oven rack to middle position, preheat to 350°F (180°C), and place the sugar in a 10-inch stainless steel skillet. Toast in the oven until fragrant and pale gold, like white sand, stirring thoroughly every 20 minutes or so to circulate sugar away from the edges of the pan. The whole process will take about 1 hour, but it can vary significantly depending on oven temperature accuracy, skillet size and shape, and frequency of stirring. Pour warm sugar into a 2-quart glass baking dish (or similar) to speed cooling and let it cool to approximately 70°F (21°C) before use. The cooled sugar can be used right away, or it can be stored in an airtight container indefinitely.Brown the Butter:In 3-quart stainless steel saucier, melt butter over medium-low heat until fluid. Increase to medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops; adjust heat as needed, so that dairy solids will not scorch before all the water can boil away. Continue cooking and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form along the pan, until butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent (an indication the water has entirely boiled away). The entire process should take about 15 minutes; substantially shorter or longer times may indicate improper heat settings.Pour into bowl of a stand mixer (there will be about 9 3/4 ounces or 276g), along with all the toasty brown bits, and cool until thick, creamy, and opaque, or approximately 70°F (21°C). This can be done passively over the course of several hours, or in about 20 minutes with a cold-water bath using a few ice cubes. Alternatively, the brown butter can be refrigerated up to a week in an airtight container and then warmed to about 70°F (21°C) before use.Getting Ready:Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorialhere). If you don’t have three pans, it’s okay to bake the cakes in stages; the batter can be held at room temperature during this time.For the Cake:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combined the cooled brown butter, the cooled toasted sugar, baking powder, vanilla, water, salt, and baking soda. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate; then increase to medium and beat until soft, fluffy, and pale, about 8 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.With the mixer still running, add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the cake flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before.When the batter looks smooth, scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula; then fold the batter once or twice from the bottom up to be sure everything is well-combined. The batter should look creamy and thick but not stiff.Divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 27 ounces or 765g). Stagger pans together on one oven rack and bake until puffed, firm, and pale gold, about 35 minutes. If oven has uneven heat, pause to rotate the pans after about 16 minutes. Alternatively, bake two layers at once and finish the third later.Cool cakes directly in their pans until no trace of warmth remains and then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment, and return cakes right side up (covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours). Prepare buttercream.For the Crumb Coat:Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directionshere) and set scraps aside for snacking. Place one layer on a heavy cast iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with second and third layers and then cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorialhere). Refrigerate cake until buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.To Finish:Rewhip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency and then use to finish and decorate the chilled cake as desired. Let the cake sit out until it reaches an internal temperature no cooler than 70°F (21°C) before serving, otherwise it will be too cold and seem greasy and dense. Cut with a chef’s knife to serve and cover exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep the cake moist. Under a cake dome, the frosted cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.Brown Butter and Toasted Sugar Make Vanilla Cake Anything But Plain","Cakes,Layer Cake,American,Easter Desserts,Mother's Day"
Sautéed Soft-Shell Crabs With Lemon-Butter Pan Sauce Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,"1/2 cup all-purpose flour,Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper,4 large soft-shell crabs, preferably jumbo or “whale” size,,cleaned,,1 stick (8 tablespoons; 120g) unsalted butter, divided,1 tablespoon drained capers,2 tablespoons (30ml) fresh lemon juice from one lemon,1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems","In a shallow bowl, season flour with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge crabs in the seasoned flour.In a 10-inch stainless steel skillet, melt 4 tablespoons (60g) butter over medium-high heat until foamy. Add crabs, shell-side down, and cook until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes; be careful, as soft-shell crabs sometimes pop in the pan. Flip crabs and cook until crisp and golden on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Transfer crabs to paper towel-lined plates and season lightly with salt.Add remaining 4 tablespoons (60g) butter to the skillet and melt until foaming.

American-Style Chocolate Buttercream Recipe,Stella Parks,"4 ounces heavy cream (about 1/2 cup; 115g), straight from the fridge,4 ounces finely chopped dark chocolate (not chips), around 72% (about 2/3 cup; 115g),12 ounces unsalted butter (3 sticks; 340g), softened to about 65°F (18°C),9 ounces organic powdered sugar (about 2 1/4 cups, spooned; 255g), preferably tapioca-based, such as,Wholesome,(see note),3 ounces high-fat Dutch cocoa powder (about 1 cup, spooned; 85g),2 teaspoons vanilla extract, plus more to taste,3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight,3/4 teaspoon instant espresso powder, plus more to taste","In a small saucepan, bring cream to a simmer. Off heat, add chopped chocolate and whisk until smooth. Set aside and cool to approximately 75°F (24°C). This can be done slowly by letting the mixture cool down over time in the saucepan, or sped up by transferring the ganache to a wide, shallow container to increase its surface area; the faster method will cool the ganache in about 30 minutes.Place butter in the bowl of a stand mixer, then sift powdered sugar and Dutch cocoa on top to ensure no lumps of either remain in the frosting. Fit stand mixer with a paddle attachment and mix on low until dry ingredients are fully incorporated.Add vanilla, salt, and espresso powder, then increase speed to medium and beat until frosting is creamy and smooth, pausing along the way to scrape bowl and beater as needed. This will take about 6 minutes, although the exact timing will vary depending on the power of the mixer and the temperature of the ingredients.Reduce speed to medium-low and add ganache. Once ganache is fully incorporated, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a spatula, then resume mixing a few seconds longer to ensure the frosting is homogeneous. Extending the beating time can create a lighter, paler frosting with a higher yield, while reduced beating can create a denser, darker frosting with a lower yield; which you choose depends on your personal preference. At this stage, the buttercream can be doctored to taste with additional salt, vanilla, or instant espresso powder.Use buttercream right away or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out air, and seal. The buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to several months. (The main issue with longer storage in the freezer is odor absorption, not spoilage.) Bring buttercream to approximately 72°F (22°C) and re-whip before use; see the troubleshooting guide below for tips on adjusting its consistency.Troubleshooting:If too cold, the frosting may seem stiff, greasy, or curdled; to fix, melt 1/4 cup frosting until liquid, then return it to the bowl and re-whip. Conversely, if too warm, the frosting may seem soft, loose, or runny; to fix, refrigerate the bowl of frosting for 10 minutes, then re-whip. It can take time to achieve the right temperature and consistency, but it gets easier with practice.American Buttercream x Ganache = Double-Chocolate Frosting","Desserts,American,Gluten-free Desserts,Chocolate"

Resume whipping on medium speed and continue whipping until cream is thick and stiff, like a frosting. Using your reserved cookie scraps, taste filling and add more salt, espresso powder, or other flavors to taste, if desired.To Assemble:This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch nonreactive, loose-bottom aluminum pan; I useLloyd Pans' 8""x4"" cheesecake pan. The recipe can also be adapted to a nonreactive springform pan of varying dimensions, although this will require individual adjustments along the way.Place about 6 ounces (170g) of the whipped filling in the loose-bottom pan and spread it around the sides in an even layer, using an offset spatula. Nestle 1 prepared cookie sheet into the bottom of the pan, pressing gently to ensure it lies flat. (Don't worry if it happens to break or crack.) Top with about 7 1/4 ounces (205g) of prepared filling and spread into an even layer. Repeat with remaining cookies and cream, using up all the remaining cream so that the last cookie has no topping. Cover cake with foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably no longer than 18 hours; chilling beyond this point may cause the cookie layer along the bottom to soften too much to be handled with ease.To Serve:Just before serving, make a few chocolate curls by running a stick peeler down the long edge of a chocolate bar, with a sheet of wax or parchment paper placed underneath to catch the curls. This works best with milk chocolate at about 70°F (21°C); the chocolate may be too brittle at cooler temperatures and tacky when warmer. Dark chocolate can also be shaved using the same technique, but this tends to work best when the chocolate is a few degrees warmer, as it can be quite brittle for shaving even at 70°F. Whip the heavy cream until it can hold medium-soft peaks.Let the chilled icebox cake stand at room temperature a few minutes to soften the exterior layer of cream. This will take about 5 minutes at roughly 70°F (21°C), or less time in warmer weather. In cooler months, it may help to briefly wrap the pan in a kitchen towel soaked in hot tap water.When ready to unmold, place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object (something tall enough to lift the icebox cake at least 4 inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base). With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Slide an offset spatula or a wide, flat cookie spatula under the icebox cake, wiggle to loosen it from the pan, then slide your hand under and transfer the cake to a serving plate. Top with whipped cream and chocolate curls. Cut into wedges using a large chef's knife, rinsing the blade clean under hot running water between slices. Serve immediately.Serving and Storage Tips:The exact shelf life of this cake will vary with how long it was refrigerated after assembly and before serving, as well as according to personal preference, as the cookies will begin to soften and disintegrate over time. Some may find this messy state of affairs wonderfully soft, while others may consider it mush. Likewise, when the cake is served as soon as possible, the cookies will remain quite toothsome and crisp; for some, this provides the perfect textural contrast, while for others, they may seem too hard.For This Mocha Icebox Cake, You’re Gonna Need a Bigger Cookie","Icebox Cake,Summer Desserts,American,Chocolate,Desserts"
Homemade Philadelphia Tomato Pie-Style Pizza Recipe,J.

Whisk to combine. Add olive oil and water. Knead on low speed just until dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Let dough rest for 10 minutes, then knead once more on low speed for 10 minutes. Dough should pull away from sides of bowl but stick to bottom.Remove dough hook, cover top of mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 24. Meanwhile, make the sauce.For the Sauce:Heat olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until butter melts. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, sugar, and whole shallot. Bring to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until rich and thick, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool in fridge while dough rises.Two hours before baking, remove dough from fridge. Generously grease the inside of a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with olive oil (about 3 tablespoons). Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Form into flat ball and transfer to baking sheet. Using your hands, coat the ball on all sides with olive oil. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic and let dough rise in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough should spread out .Carefully stretch and push the dough into the corners and edges of the pan. Cover loosely, and let rise for 1 hour longer. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. When dough has risen, gently dock center with finger tips and use your hands to create a risen ridge about 1-inch wide around the edge.Spread sauce generously over dough, leaving the raised 1-inch edge un-sauced.

Light and Thin Pancakes From Homemade Pancake Mix Recipe,Stella Parks,",For the Pancake Mix:,,4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal blue label (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g),1/2 ounce sugar (about 1 tablespoon; 15g),1/2 ounce malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Hoosier Hill Farms (about 2 tablespoons; 15g),1 1/2 teaspoons (6.8g) baking powder,1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight,1/4 teaspoon (1.6g) baking soda,2 1/2 ounces refined coconut oil, solid and firm, between 68°F and 72°F (about 1/3 cup; 70g),,For the Pancakes:,,6 ounces milk,,any percentage will do,, or nondairy alternatives (about 3/4 cup; 170g),1 large egg, straight from the fridge (1 3/4 ounces; 50g),1/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons ; 7g),1 batch pancake mix, above (about 1 1/2 cups; 8 1/4 ounces; 233g)","For the Pancake Mix:In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, malted milk powder, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Process about 30 seconds to ensure the leavening agents are fully homogenized into flour.Add the solid coconut oil and pulse only until it disappears into a dry and powdery mix, just a few seconds. It's important that the coconut oil is fully combined into the flour, while also remaining powdery and dry, so use caution and avoid over-processing, especially with larger batches (a 14-cup food processor can handle a maximum batch size of 4x; plan accordingly for smaller machines). Transfer the mix to an airtight container and store up to one year at or below 74°F, or until the date stamped on the package of coconut oil.For the Pancakes:Preheat an electric griddle to 350°F, or heat a large, nonstick skillet to a similar temperature on the stovetop. In a large mixing bowl, whisk milk, egg, and vanilla extract until well-combined. Add prepared pancake mix and whisk until smooth, although a few flecks of coconut oil may dot the batter.With a large scoop, measuring cup, or ladle, divide the thin batter in 1/4-cup portions (or as desired) and griddle until golden brown on either side, and cooked through the middle, about 90 seconds per side. Serve immediately, with butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or whatever other toppings sound fun.Troubleshooting:The timing and yield of this recipe will vary substantially depending on how the pancake batter is portioned as well as the exact temperature of the griddle itself. When pancakes are excessively browned but raw in the middle, the griddle is likely too hot; when the pancakes are cooked through but too soft and pale, the griddle may be too cool.Just Add Milk and an Egg for the Easiest Homemade Pancake Mix","Pancakes,American,Stovetop,Quick Breakfast,Mother's Day"

Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here.If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorialhere). In either case, lightly grease the pan.For the Graham Cracker Crust:Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan.For the Cheesecake:Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450°F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking.Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250°F until done; this may take an hour or more.Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250°F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145°F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more.Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours.Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan:Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan:Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.To Serve:Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit, if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.Meet the Towering, Insanely Creamy New York–Style Cheesecake of Your Dreams","Cheesecakes,Cakes,American,Cherry,Summer Desserts"

Add 3 tablespoons of the marinade from the zipper-lock bag and work it into the flour with your fingertips. Remove one piece of chicken from the bag, allowing excess buttermilk to drip off, drop the chicken into the flour mixture, and toss to coat. Continue adding chicken pieces to the flour mixture one at a time until they are all in the bowl. Toss the chicken until every piece is thoroughly coated, pressing with your hands to get the flour to adhere in a thick layer.Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the shortening or oil to 425°F in a 12-inch straight-sided cast-iron chicken fryer or a large wok over medium-high heat.

Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Once all the chicken pieces are coated, place skin side down in the pan. The temperature should drop to 300°F; adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 300°F for the duration of the cooking. Fry the chicken until it’s a deep golden brown on the first side, about 6 minutes; do not move the chicken or start checking for doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off the coating.

Pure and Simple Slow-Cooked Boston Baked Beans Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,"1 pound dried small white beans (about 2 cups; 450g), such as navy beans,Kosher salt,Assorted peeled, halved, and trimmed aromatic vegetables (such as 1 yellow onion, 1 carrot, and 2 cloves garlic), optional,2 sprigs of a woodsy herb (such as rosemary, sage, and/or thyme), optional,1 bay leaf,1/2 cup (120ml) dark molasses (not blackstrap),2 teaspoons (10ml) Dijon or brown mustard,Freshly ground black pepper,1/2 pound (225g) salt pork or slab bacon, rinsed of excess salt if necessary and cut into 1/2-inch chunks (see note),1 large yellow onion, diced (about 8 ounces; 225g) (see note),Apple cider vinegar, to taste (optional)","In a medium bowl, cover beans with cold water by several inches and stir in 1 tablespoon (15g) salt. Let beans soak at least 12 hours and up to 1 day. Drain and rinse.Combine beans with aromatic vegetables and herbs (if using) and bay leaf in a large pot and cover with water by several inches. Add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, topping up with water as necessary, until beans are fully tender, about 45 minutes. Using tongs, discard vegetables and aromatics.Meanwhile, pour molasses into a 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Add mustard, a very generous dose of freshly ground black pepper (let it rain!), and a pinch of salt.Drain beans, reserving cooking liquid. Add enough bean-cooking liquid to molasses mixture to bring the volume up to 2 cups (475ml) and stir until molasses is completely dissolved. Reserve remaining bean-cooking liquid.Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). In a Dutch oven, cook pork over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered and pork is beginning to lightly brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring, until onion is very tender and just beginning to turn golden, about 6 minutes. Add beans to pot.Add bean water/molasses mixture and stir well to combine. Add enough reserved bean-cooking water to just barely cover beans, then stir once more, leveling out beans so that none are sticking up above the liquid level. Bring to a simmer.Transfer beans to oven and bake, uncovered, until beans are extremely tender but still mostly whole, with only a small fraction beginning to burst, about 4 hours. Check beans once or twice per hour during baking, adding remaining bean-cooking liquid (switching eventually to boiling water if you run out) as needed to prevent the beans on the surface from drying out. Stir beans twice during the baking process to submerge the top ones, leveling them out each time; over time, a dark, browned crust will form on the surface of the beans (this is good). The goal throughout is to keep the liquid level just high enough that the upper beans don't desiccate, but not so high that the surface doesn't brown. Stop adding liquid during the last hour of baking unless the level becomes perilously low.Remove beans from oven and stir them very well. The sauce should form into a thickened, starchy glaze. If it's too dry, add boiling water sparingly until a glaze is achieved; if it's too wet, simmer briefly on the stovetop until reduced to desired consistency. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If beans are too sweet for your taste, a small splash of cider vinegar can help balance the flavor (though I never thought my beans needed it).Keep warm until ready to serve. Beans can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Reheat in a saucepan, adding water gradually as needed to loosen them back up.How to Make Boston Baked Beans, the Low, Slow, Old-Fashioned Way","New England,Braised & Stewed Beans,White Beans,Beans Sides,Fall Sides"

Stir to combine, then add water. Mix on low speed until dough comes together into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for 10 minutes. Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky ball, about 10 minutes longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads rather than riding around the edges.) Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.To Make the Dough in a Food Processor:Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add water, then turn on processor and process until dough forms a ball that rides around the bowl of the processor, about 30 seconds. Continue processing for 30 seconds longer. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.To Make the Dough by Hand:Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to combine, then add water and stir with a wooden spoon until a rough ball of dough has formed. Set aside for 10 minutes. Turn dough out onto a countertop and knead until a smooth, silky ball has formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in half if using cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in oil. Press down on dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be able to get it all the way to the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then cover tightly in plastic and set aside for 30 minutes to allow dough to relax. Return to dough and stretch it out again. It should be able to reach the edges this time. If not, let it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into place. Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make the sauce.For the Sauce:Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C), or as close to it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.To Form the Pizza:Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove any large air bubbles. Lay half of pepperoni (if using) evenly over face of dough. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very edges of the pan, then add remaining pepperoni. Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You will need only about half the sauce—save the rest for another pizza.)Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese on top is starting to lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Transfer sauce to a blender, and blend until very smooth (you may be able to make an immersion blender work, but in our tests the sauce level was too low to safely avoid splattering). Wipe out pot, then return blended sauce to it. Season lightly with salt.In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until just shy of al dente, about 3 minutes less than the package directs. About 1 minute before you transfer pasta to sauce, add vodka to tomato sauce and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat.Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer pasta directly to sauce pot along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta water (alternatively, reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain pasta in a colander, then add to sauce with 1/2 cup of the reserved water). Increase heat to high, and cook, stirring constantly, until pasta is well coated in sauce and reaches the al dente stage, about 3 minutes. If sauce thickens too much before pasta is ready, add more pasta water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed. [Shown here with one serving size.]Remove from heat and stir in cheese until thoroughly incorporated into a smooth and creamy sauce. Taste for salt, and season with more if needed. If you can't detect the vodka at all, you can add a few drops more and stir it in before serving; exactly how boozy you want the sauce is a question of taste, but be careful because a heavy hand will ruin the dish. Spoon pasta and sauce onto warmed serving plates and top with additional grated cheese. Serve immediately.","Pastas,Italian-American,Stovetop Pasta,Creamy Pastas,Tomato Sauces"

Transfer pumpkin seeds to a bowl and set aside.Add chicken, tomatillos, onion, peppers, chicken stock, oregano, epazote (if using), and a large pinch of salt to the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a bare simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken and vegetables are completely tender, about 40 minutes.Using tongs, transfer chicken to a large plate or bowl and set aside. Discard epazote sprigs (if using). Set a large fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the broth through it. Transfer solids to the jar of a blender. Add pumpkin seeds and cilantro to the blender. Blend on high speed until smooth. Set aside.Using a ladle, carefully skim off a few tablespoons of fat from the strained stock and add it to the Dutch oven (it's okay if a little stock gets in as well). Heat over high heat, swirling and stirring until the watery stock completely evaporates and starts to form a browned layer in the bottom of the pan. (It will spatter a bit. The more you stir, the less it will spatter.) As soon as the chicken fat starts to smoke, pour in the contents of the blender all at once and cook, stirring, for about 15 seconds (it will spatter a lot—wear an apron!). Immediately pour in strained chicken stock and fat and stir to combine. Bring to a bare simmer, stir in hominy, season to taste with salt, and keep warm.By this stage, the chicken should be cool enough to handle. Discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces with your fingertips. Stir the picked chicken back into the soup.To Serve:Ladle the hot soup into bowls and garnish with diced avocado and radish, sliced chilies, chopped cilantro, and chopped white onion.

Turn mixer to low speed and mix until dry ingredients are well combined, about 30 seconds. Turn off mixer, detach whisk, and use it to scrape down bowl to quickly incorporate any unmixed flour.Attach the paddle attachment. Turn mixer to low. Add half the lard in a slow stream, then turn mixer up to medium speed and slowly pour in the remaining lard until fat is incorporated and flour becomes crumbly but still soft and powdery to the touch.With the mixer still at medium speed, add milk in intervals, pouring it steadily in 3-second additions followed by 3-second pauses to allow the milk to mix in. Repeat until all the milk has been added. Increase mixer speed to high and let run until dough is smooth and elastic, 3 minutes.Using bench scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough into a clean medium mixing bowl, cover with plastic, and let rest at room temperature for at least 1 and up to 2 hours.Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Dust a work surface with flour. Turn dough out onto work surface and divide evenly into 12 portions (about 1 3/4 ounces, or 50 grams, each). Working with 1 dough portion at a time and keeping the rest covered with a clean kitchen towel to prevent drying, dust the dough portion, then gently roll it into a ball; transfer dough ball to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough portions, then wrap baking sheet tightly with plastic. Let stand 15 minutes.Heat a dry 10-inch cast iron pan over medium heat; make sure to have a plastic bag, clean kitchen towel, or tortilla warmer nearby to hold the cooked tortillas. Lightly flour the work surface once more. Working with one dough ball at a time and keeping the rest covered with plastic to prevent drying, place a ball on the work surface and sprinkle lightly with flour. Gently press the ball down with your palm to make a flattened puck shape.Using a rolling pin and working from the center of the puck toward its top edge, gently roll out the dough ball, being careful not to roll past the top edge. Roll the rolling pin back toward the bottom edge, being careful not to roll past the bottom edge. Flip the dough over and rotate it 45 degrees clockwise. Dust with more flour, if needed, then repeat rolling process. Continue to flip, rotate, flour, and roll the dough until a roughly 8-inch round tortilla has formed.Transfer tortilla to preheated pan and let cook until tortilla begins to bubble, about 10 seconds. Continue cooking about 15 second longer, until brown spots have developed on bottom side, then flip tortilla and cook on second side until browned and blistered in spots, about 10 seconds, adjusting heat as necessary to lightly brown the tortilla without burning it. Place the tortilla in the plastic bag (or tortilla warmer or wrapped in the clean towel) to keep warm and prevent drying. Repeat the rolling and cooking process with the remaining dough balls.

Easy Nixtamalized Corn Tortillas Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,"200g (7 ounces) dried white, yellow, or blue dent or field corn (see note),600ml (2 1/2 cups) water, plus more as needed,3g,pickling lime,(or other food-grade slaked lime) (see note),,Masa harina para tortillas,, as needed","In a medium pot, combine corn and water; pick out any stones that may be hiding among the corn kernels. Add pickling lime and set over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, adjusting heat to maintain simmer. Cook until corn is tenderized but not overly soft, about 45 minutes. (You can chew a kernel up to test, or break one open: It's done when the kernel looks mostly hydrated but still has a tiny core of visible starchiness.) The timing can vary based on corn type, so start checking at 30 minutes and continue cooking beyond 45 minutes if it's still too raw. Top up with water as needed to keep corn submerged.Remove from heat, cover pot, and let corn stand at room temperature overnight. The bran on the corn should now rub off easily. Drain corn in a colander, set under running cold water, and rub kernels vigorously between hands to remove most of the bran; corn should turn a brighter shade as bran comes off. Allow to drain well, then transfer corn to a food processor.Process corn at high speed, adding as much water as you need, little by little, to help the blades process the corn, about 10 minutes; scrape down the sides of the bowl at least a few times during processing. The dough is ready when no large corn chunks remain and the purée has the texture of a thick hummus.Scrape corn dough into a mixing bowl and add masa harina, little by little, working it in with your hands, until corn dough has the texture of Play-Doh: soft and supple, but not wet. To test texture, roll a small ball of dough between your hands, then press it between your fingers: If the edges crack, it's too dry, but if it sticks to your skin, it's too wet. Work in more water or masa harina, little by little, until you hit that sweet spot.Cut 2 sides plus the zipper-top off of a zipper-lock bag, leaving it attached on only 1 side; line tortilla press with the plastic and trim to fit. Preheat well-seasoned griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Working with one piece at a time, roll a portion of corn dough into a golf ball–sized ball, then flatten slightly. Set portioned corn dough between the sheets of plastic, then press flat using the tortilla press. Try not to press so hard that the tortilla edge becomes too thin; about 1mm in thickness or slightly less is what you want. Rotate plastic 180 degrees and press again to ensure even thickness.Carefully peel tortilla from plastic and place in preheated skillet. Cook until bottom side is dried, about 30 seconds, then flip using a thin metal spatula and cook other side until dried, about 30 seconds longer; tortilla may puff up and brown lightly in spots, which is fine. Adjust heat as necessary to prevent scorching. (If tortillas start to stick to griddle or skillet, rub cooking surface with a paper towel lightly moistened with vegetable oil, then buff away any excess oiliness.)Stack tortillas as they are done, keeping them wrapped in a clean kitchen towel or tortilla holder to trap heat and steam.

Add chicken stock (it should boil immediately), then pour contents of saucepan into a small heatproof bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set aside.Wipe out saucepan, add oil, and return to medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Add cumin, oregano, and achiote and cook, stirring frequently, until spices are bloomed and aromatic but not browned, about 30 seconds. Stir in chipotle and adobo sauce and cook for 30 seconds longer. Stir in vinegar, salt, and sugar, and remove saucepan from heat.Transfer contents of saucepan to a blender along with garlic and chilies with their steeping liquid. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, scraping down sides of blender jar with a rubber spatula as needed, about 1 minute. Set aside.Freeze pork for 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes (partially freezing the pork makes it easier to slice). Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice pork against the grain into 2-inch-long, 1-inch-wide, and 1/8-inch-thick strips. The easiest and most efficient way to do this is to start by portioning the pork butt into 2-inch-wide by 1-inch-thick pieces, and then slicing those pieces crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick strips.Combine pork and marinade in a large bowl, and using hands, toss until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36 hours.For the Skewers and Serving:Thread one piece of pork onto a skewer, piercing it through twice to secure it, then bunching meat tightly together like an accordion. Then thread one piece of pineapple onto skewer. Continue alternating pieces of pork with pineapple, ending the skewer with a piece of pork. Make sure meat and pineapple are bunched tightly together, leaving no parts of the skewer exposed except for a 2-inch handle at the bottom, and the pointy tip at the top. Repeat skewering process with remaining pork and pineapple.Set up grill for skewers,making sure to adjust distance between bricks to the length of your skewers.Light one chimney full of charcoal.When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly in the channel between the bricks.Place skewers directly over the hot coals, balancing them on top of the bricks, with the handles overhanging the bricks closest to you, and the tips balancing on the farther wall of bricks. Cook, turning frequently, until pork and pineapple are lightly charred, and a piece of pork looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, 8 to 10 minutes; if flare-ups occur, move the skewers around as needed to get them away from the flames. Transfer to serving platter and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately, passing lime wedges, as well as cilantro and salsa (if using), at the table.How to Set Up Your Grill for Better Skewers, Kebabs, and YakitoriFor the EasiestAl Pastorat Home, Put a Skewer in It","Grilled Pork,Labor Day,Pork,Mexican,Pineapple"

Nilla Knockoffs Recipe,Stella Parks,"8 ounces flour,4 ounces unsalted butter,3 1/2 ounces sugar,1 ounce honey,1/4 teaspoon baking soda,1/4 teaspoon salt,1/2 ounce vanilla extract,4 egg yolks,3 ounces cream, plus extra for washing","Make the cookie batter:Preheat the oven to 325°F and line two cookie sheets with parchment, set aside.Sift the flour in a sieve.With a hand or stand mixer (fitted with a paddle attachment), cream together the butter, sugar, honey, baking soda, salt and vanilla extract. Cream for about 5 minutes on medium speed, until light and fluffy. About halfway through the mixing, scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula.After 5 minutes, with the mixer still running, add the eggs yolks, one at a time. Let each addition fully incorporate before adding the next.Turn the mixer to low and add in the flour all at once. While it is mixing, drizzle in the cream. Continue mixing until homogenous. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the batter to a piping bag, fitted with a 1/2"" plain tip.Pipe and bake the cookies:Pipe the cookies into 1"" wide rounds on the prepared cookie sheets. Don't worry if they have little peaks, you'll fix those later. Just try to keep the cookies all roughly the same size to ensure even baking.Once all of the cookies have been piped, brush each one lightly with a pastry brush dipped in cream. You're not looking to coat the cookies, but to smooth the peaks down and give them an even, smooth surface texture.Once the cookies have been brushed, bake approximately 18 minutes or until the cookies are firm to the touch and golden brown. To make perfectly round wafers, use a 1 1/2"" cookie cutter to trim each cookie before they cool.Transfer the cookies, while still slightly warm, to an airtight container and seal. This will slightly steam the cookies and give them that less than crisp Nilla texture. If you prefer a crisper wafer, allow the cookies to cool completely before storing.The cookies will keep, at room temperature, for several weeks.BraveTart: How to Make Your Own Nilla Wafers","Cookies,North American"
Little Debbie-Style Christmas Tree Cakes Recipe,Stella Parks,"For the Yellow Cake:,6 ounce sugar,1 ounce brown sugar,1 teaspoon baking powder,1/2 teaspoon baking soda,1/2 teaspoon salt,1/2 teaspoon almond extract,1 tablespoon vanilla extract,3 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature,4 1/2 ounces egg yolks (from about 6 eggs),8 ounces flour,6 ounces milk,2 ounces spiced rum, like Captain Morgan's,,Chocolate or Vanilla filling:,4 ounces milk,1 egg,1 1/4 ounces sugar,1/8 ounce cornstarch,1/8 ounce cocoa powder (omit for vanilla version),1 ounces milk chocolate (omit for vanilla version),Pinch salt,8 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature,1 tablespoon vanilla extract (increase to 2 tablespoons for vanilla version),,Hard glaze:,18 ounces powdered sugar (use 20 ounces for vanilla version),6 ounces water, divided,2 teaspoons salt,1/2 ounce vanilla extract,1 1/2 ounces cocoa powder (omit for vanilla version),Sprinkles to garnish","Make and bake the cake layers:Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two jelly roll style sheet pans with a sheet of parchment.With a hand or stand mixer, cream together the sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, almond extract, vanilla extract and butter. Cream for about 6 minutes on medium speed, or until light and fluffy. Stop about halfway through to scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula.While the mixture is creaming, sift the flour through a sieve and set aside.While still mixing at medium speed, begin adding in the yolks, one at a time. Mix thoroughly after each addition.Turn the mixer to low speed and, with it still running, add half of the flour. Drizzle in half the milk. Repeat with the remaining flour, milk and rum. Continue mixing only until homogenous.Shut off the mixer and scrape the bowl down with a spatula and stir, if necessary, to incorporate any lumps of batter around the sides of the bowl.Divide the batter evenly between the two sheet pans and use an offset spatula to spread the batter into an even layer. Rap the pans against the counter a few times to dislodge any air bubbles.Bake for five minutes. You'll notice at this time some uneven bubbling occurring in the cakes. Remove the cakes from the oven and shake gently or rap against the counter to deflate the bubbles. Rotate the cake pans and continue baking another five minutes or until uniformly pale-golden and spongy to the touch.Set aside to cool until needed.Make the filling:In a small pot, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat.In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, sugar, cornstarch and cocoa. While whisking, drizzle in the hot milk. Return the milk/egg mixture to the pot and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly. Whisk until the mixture begins to bubble and continue mixing one minutes more, to thoroughly cook out the cornstarch.Use a spatula to transfer the cooked custard to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add in the chocolate and salt. Using the paddle attachment, beat on low speed for 10 minutes, or until the mixture and the bowl itself have become cool to the touch.Once cool, turn the speed up to medium and, with the mixer still running, add the butter one tablespoon at a time, then drizzle in the vanilla. Shut off the mixer and let stand until needed.Assemble and cut the cakes:Run a knife around the edges of the cake pans to loosen the cakes. Place a sheet of parchment over both cakes. Next you need to invert both cakes, remove the parchment paper from their bottoms, then re-invert them right-side up.More detailed explanation: invert one of the cakes onto a cutting board, set the sheet pan aside, and very gently peel away the bottom layer of parchment. Invert the second cake onto the bottom of the now empty sheet pan from the first cake (it's easier to handle the cake when it's on the bottom of the sheet pan, rather than nestled down into the sheet pan and hard to access). Likewise, peel away parchment paper. Now re-invert this second cake to the bottom of its original sheet pan. You now have both cakes right side up, one on a cutting board, one on an upside down sheet pan.Use a rubber spatula to transfer all of the chocolate buttercream from the bowl to the cake resting on the cutting board. With an offset spatula, spread the buttercream out as evenly as possible, from corner to corner. Hold the sheet pan with the second cake over the buttercreamed cake; gently slide the cake off the sheet pan and on to the buttercream. Press the cake down gently with your fingers to ensure the layers are even.Wrap the cutting board in plastic and freeze for one hour. Freezing the cake solidifies the buttercream and makes cutting it into tidy shapes much easier.To cut into Christmas trees, remove the cake from the freezer and cut lengthwise into two long strips, 4"" wide. There will be a 2"" strip leftover for snacking.Cut each strip with a chef's knife in a zig zag pattern to create a series of isosceles triangles, 3"" wide at the base.Arrange all of the triangles to their narrowest end points away from you. This is the basic shape of the tree. Trim away a small notch on either side of the base of the triangle to leave behind a 1"" wide trunk shape.Cover the trees loosely in plastic and freeze or refrigerate until needed.Prepare the glaze:In the smallest pot you have that will accommodate the ingredients, combine the powdered sugar, half the water, salt and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine. Set the pot over medium low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the powdered sugar has dissolved and the mixture just beings to bubble. Remove from heat. Set aside a 1/2 cup of this vanilla glaze.Now add in the remaining water and cocoa powder (if using) and whisk until combined. Cool to room temperature.Glaze and decorate the cakes:Have a sheet pan lined with parchment paper ready.Remove the cakes from the freezer and drop one straight into the center of the glaze. Use a fork to splash some glaze over the top of the cake. Next, lift the cake up and out of the glaze. Let any excess glaze drip back into the pot. Lightly drag the bottom of the cake/fork against the edge of the pot to minimize dripping and excess glaze. Gently place the cake onto the prepared sheet pan.Repeat with the remaining cakes. For a thick, dark coating, let the cakes dry for about an hour, then make a second batch of glaze (reserving none of the vanilla) and dip the cakes again. If given only one glaze, the cake will show through the glaze in patches. Whether you dip a second round is entirely up to your sense of perfectionism; one glaze is all it takes for a delicious cake.Once all of the cakes have been glazed, drizzle with the remaining vanilla glaze (tint the glaze red, if making the vanilla version). If the glaze has become too firm to drizzle, add in a teaspoon of water and stir to thin. Drizzle with a spoon, or with a pastry bag fitted with a small, plain tip. Finally, scatter sprinkles all over.Place the tray of cakes in a well ventilated and safe location where they may dry, undisturbed by pets or children. Let the cakes stand, uncovered, for about six hours or until the glaze has set. Exactly how long this takes will depend on the air flow and humidity in your home.Once the glaze has set, the cakes are ready for snacking! (Use a spatula to lift the cakes from the parchment, once free, you can handle them easily.)The cakes will store, covered, at room temperature for about 2 days, or up to a week in the fridge.BraveTart: Little Debbie-Style Christmas Tree Cakes","Cakes,North American,Christmas Cookies,Christmas Desserts"

Set aside.In a medium bowl melt the milk chocolate, either in a microwave or over a water bath, and stir until it has cooled to body temperature. It's important the chocolate is not hot before proceeding to the next step. Once the chocolate has cooled, use a rubber spatula to stir in the oil, corn syrup, brown sugar, baking soda, egg yolk and vanilla extract. If you wish to use dye for a Soft Batch color match, use a toothpick to add just a little to the dough & stir it in with the spatula.Stir in the dry ingredients all at once with a spatula, fold in the mini-chips last (reserving 24 chips for garnish.)Shape and bake the cookies:Use a #60 ice cream scoop to divide the dough into about 24 equal portions. If you don't have a scoop, you can use a plain spoon—just take care, Soft Batch cookies are really quite small. If you'd like especially authentic cookies, roll each portion of dough between your hands and into a perfect sphere. The dough is soft, so its shape will relax slightly after you place it on the cookie sheet.Place 12 on each cookie sheet, spaced evenly. Garnish each with one mini chip, placed somewhere off center.Bake for approximately 6 minutes or until the dough has puffed but not fully set. You may need to experiment to find the perfect time, but the important part is to take them out of the oven when the edges appear fully baked, but the center still seems puffed and damp. Do not over bake.Aging the cookies: Cool the cookies directly on the tray for 10 minutes, then transfer to an airtight container while still slightly warm. Place a sheet of parchment or wax paper between each layer, as the cookies will readily fuse together if touching. Close the lid of the container and age the cookies for at least 24 hours.BraveTart: Make Your Own (Better) Soft Batch Cookies","Cookies,North American,Baking,Chocolate"
