1/4 cup (60ml) red wine vinegar

12 ounces (340g) mixed ripe tomatoes, cut into slices and chunks (about 2 heaping cups when cut up)

12 ounces cucumber (340g; about 2 small cucumbers), peeled (or partially peeled or unpeeled, if you want some of the bitter skin); quartered lengthwise; and thinly sliced crosswise

1/4 cup pitted Kalamata or other briny black olives (about 1 1/2 ounces; 40g), see note

1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

Tri-Tip Beef Roast With Shallot Jus Recipe,Sasha Marx,South American,"1 whole tri-tip roast, about 2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 quart (950ml) beef stock or brown chicken stock (see note)

1 1/4 cups (300ml) red wine, divided

2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil

1 pound (450g) shallots, thinly sliced

1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce","The Day Before Roasting: Using butcher's twine, tie tri-tip at 1-inch intervals using butcher's knots. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, at least overnight and up to 2 nights.

When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225°F (105°C). Place baking sheet with rack and tri-tip in oven and roast until internal temperature registers 115°F (46°C) on an instant-read thermometer at the tri-tip's thickest point, about 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine stock and 1 cup (240ml) red wine over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, occasionally scraping down sides of saucier with a rubber spatula, until mixture thickens slightly and is reduced to 2 cups (475ml), 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off heat.

Just before tri-tip comes out of the oven, add oil to a 12-inch cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel skillet and heat over high heat until smoking. Add tri-tip to skillet and cook, using a small cast iron skillet or weight to press down on tri-tip for even browning. If the beef begins to char or the skillet begins smoking aggressively, reduce heat to medium-high. Cook until tri-tip is evenly browned on all sides and internal temperature registers 130°F (54°C), about 5 minutes.

Transfer tri-tip to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add shallots to now-empty skillet, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are softened and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) red wine to skillet and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

Transfer shallot mixture to saucier with reduced stock and red wine mixture and stir to combine. Bring jus to a simmer over high heat and stir in soy sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cut and remove twine from tri-tip, then cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick slices if you are serving the beef as a main course. Slice into thin, 2-inch-wide pieces if you plan to serve the beef in sandwiches. Serve right away, passing shallot jus at the table.","Tri Tips,British,Roasted Beef,Beef Mains,Christmas Dinners",https://www.seriouseats.com/tri-tip-roast-beef-recipe
Guava and Cream Cheese Pastelitos Recipe,María del Mar Cuadra,West Coast,"All-purpose flour for dusting counter

2 sheets (one 17.3-ounce package) frozen puff pastry, thawed according to package instructions (see notes)

8 ounces cream cheese, cut into small pieces and softened

6 tablespoons sour cream

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1/2 teaspoon salt

8 ounces guava paste, cut into 1/4-inch cubes

2 egg yolks","Adjust oven racks to upper third and lower third positions and preheat oven to 400°F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.

Lightly dust the counter and rolling pin with flour. Roll out each puff pastry sheet to a 12-inch square. Cut each into quarters to make four 6-inch squares.

Beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream, lemon juice, and salt until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.

Place 2 tablespoons cream cheese mixture in center of each square. Evenly distribute guava cubes among squares, arranging them on top of the cream cheese mixture.

In a small bowl, beat egg yolks and remaining 2 tablespoons sour cream. Brush edges of each square with egg wash, then, fold the squares diagonally to form triangles. Seal the edges by pressing them with the tines of a fork. Brush triangles with egg wash.

Place the pastelitos on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake until puffed and golden, 12 to 15 minutes, alternating baking sheets halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheets to cooling racks. Cool pastelitos on sheets 5 to 10 minutes prior to serving. May be eaten at room temperature.

Salteñas (Bolivian Hand Pies Filled With Chicken Stew) Recipe,Sohla El-Waylly,New England,"For the stock:

2 1/2 pounds (1.13kg) chicken wings

1/2 small onion (5.3 ounces; 150g), roughly chopped

2 cloves garlic (1/2 ounce; 12g), smashed

1 medium red bell pepper (8.2 ounces; 230g), roughly chopped

For the stew:

2 tablespoons reserved chicken fat (1 ounce; 30g)

4 chicken thighs (about 1.8 pounds; 800g)

kosher salt

1 medium onion (10.7 ounces; 300g), chopped into 1/4 inch dice

2 cloves garlic (1/2 ounce; 12g), minced finely

1 teaspoon aji panca powder (or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne), see note

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1/2 teaspoon hot paprika

1 tablespoon dried oregano

1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1 medium russet potato (5 ounces; 140g), peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch dice

1/2 cup golden raisins (3.2 ounces; 90g)

1/2 cup frozen peas (3.5 ounces; 100g)

For the dough:

1 cup unsalted butter (8 ounces; 226g)

2 teaspoons annatto powder

3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (1 pound; 454g)

2 teaspoons (.5 ounce; 12g) Diamond crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same by weight

6 tablespoons sugar (2.7 ounces; 75g)

To assemble:

3 hardboiled eggs, quartered

9 black olives, halved

1 egg white","For the stock: Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Spread the chicken wings in a roasting pan and bake until deeply golden brown, about 40 minutes. Pour off any rendered chicken fat and reserve for cooking.

Transfer the wings from the roasting pan to a stock pot. Add 1 cup of water to the roasting pan and scrape up any brown bits with a wooden spoon. Pour the water and brown bits to a stockpot. Add enough water to cover the wings and simmer for 3 1/2 hours, adding more water if needed to keep chicken wings submerged. (Alternatively, simmer the wings in a pressure cooker at full pressure for 1 1/2 hours.)

Add the onion, garlic, and bell pepper to the stock and simmer an additional 30 minutes. Strain the stock and reduce further or add more water until the yield is 5 cups.

For the stew: Add the chicken fat to a 6-quart Dutch oven or similar heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pot and heat over medium-high until the fat shimmers. Season chicken thighs with salt and sear, skin side down, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip chicken and sear on other side until browned, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside. Drain any excess fat from pot and lower heat to medium.

Add diced onion and minced garlic to pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the chicken, until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add aji panca or cayenne, cumin, paprika, oregano, and black pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Increase heat to high, then add chicken wing stock, diced potato, and raisins and bring to a simmer. Season with salt. Return chicken thighs to pot along with any accumulated juices. Reduce heat to low. Cover and gently simmer until chicken has cooked through, about 30 minutes.

Remove the stew from heat and set aside until the chicken is cool enough to handle, about 1 hour (The chicken should be left to cool in the stew so that it doesn't dry out.) Using your hands, pick the meat from the chicken thighs and break into small pieces, discarding the skin and bones. Stir peas and picked chicken meat into the stew and refrigerate until the stew has solidified, about 4 hours, preferably overnight, and up to 3 days in advance.

For the dough: In a 2-quart saucepan, combine butter and annatto and melt to infuse the butter with color.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Pour the melted butter into the flour mixture and, using your hands, mix until thoroughly combined and sandy. Add 3/4 cup (177mL) hot water to the flour mixture and mix until the dough comes together into a smooth ball.

Divide the dough into 9 equal portions (about 100 grams each). Fold each portion of dough onto itself until it becomes smooth and pat into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap.

Assembly: Work with one portion of dough at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered. Lightly dust your work surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out one portion of dough into an 8-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Loosen the dough from the work surface with an offset spatula.

Add 1/9 (about 1 generous cup) of the chilled chicken stew to the center of the dough. Top it with a quarter of a hardboiled egg and two black olive halves. Brush the edges of the dough with egg white. Join the edges of the dough together over the filling. Press the edges together to encase the filling into a large football with a seam running across the top. Crimp the edges and transfer the salteña to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Freeze the formed salteñas before baking at least 1 hour and up to 3 months in advance. (If freezing long-term, once the salteñas are fully frozen, wrap each in plastic and transfer to a zip lock freezer bag to prevent freezer burn.)

Baking: If the salteñas have been frozen for only 1 hour, preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C). If the salteñas have been frozen solid for 4 hours or more, preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment and spray lightly with cooking spray. Line the tray with the frozen salteñas. (Do not bake on the chilled baking sheet the salteñas were frozen on or the bottom of the pastry will not brown.) Brush the pastries with egg white and bake until the seam is blackened and the crust is golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Serve immediately.","Savory,South American,Braised & Stewed Chicken,Chicken Thighs",https://www.seriouseats.com/saltenas-bolivian-hand-pies-filled-with-chicken-stew
Coddled Eggs With Marmite Mushrooms Recipe,Sydney Oland,American,"2 teaspoons butter

16 ounces button mushrooms, sliced

3 shallots

2 teaspoons picked fresh thyme leaves

1/2 cup homemade or store-bought low sodium chicken stock

1 teaspoon Marmite

Kosher salt and cracked black pepper

4 eggs

Sliced scallions

Cooked bacon and dressed greens for serving.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 425°F. Melt the butter in a medium non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms release their liquid, the liquid evaporates, and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the shallots and thyme and cook, stirring, until shallots are just beginning to brown, about 3 minutes longer. Add the stock and the Marmite, stirring so that Marmite dissolves into the sauce, then bring to a simmer and cook until the stock has reduced to a saucelike consistency, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide the mushrooms between the ramekins, using a spoon to make a well in the center. Break an egg into each well, then place ramekins on a baking sheet and bake until eggs have just set, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sliced scallions, season eggs with salt, and serve immediately with bacon and lightly dressed greens on the side.","Breakfast & Brunch,British,Eggs,Mushrooms",https://www.seriouseats.com/coddled-eggs-marmite-recipe

Chicken-Fried Steak Nuggets with Beer and Bourbon Gravy Recipe,Marvin Gapultos,American,"1 1/2 pounds top sirloin or top round cube steak, cut into bite-sized pieces

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 eggs, beaten

1 1/2 cups whole milk, divided

1 cup all-purpose flour

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1 to 2 cups canola, vegetable, or peanut oil

2 tablespoons bourbon

1/2 cup beer

1 sprig fresh thyme","Preheat oven to 175°F. Season the steak on all sides with salt and black pepper and set aside. In a shallow dish, combine the eggs and 1/2 cup milk. In another shallow dish, combine the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne. Working in batches, dredge the meat in the flour mixture, then in the egg mixture, and again into the flour mixture, shaking off any excess flour or egg wash. Lay the coated pieces of meat on a wire rack. Reserve any extra flour for use in thickening the gravy.

Add enough oil to just cover the bottom of a large cast iron skillet, Dutch oven, or flat-bottomed wok by 1/2 inch. Heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Carefully add just enough coated steak to make a single layer in the bottom of the pan. Cook until golden brown and crisp on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes per side.

Melba Wilson's Southern Fried Chicken and Eggnog Waffles Recipe | Cook the Book,Caroline Russock,American,"For the chicken:

1 (3-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 teaspoon sweet Spanish paprika

1 teaspoon poultry seasoning

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1 tablespoon brown mustard

2 cups buttermilk

Peanut or vegetable oil, for frying

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons Sazonador seasoning

For the eggnog waffles:

2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted

2 teaspoons baking powder

Pinch of ground cinnamon

Pinch of ground nutmeg

2 cups eggnog

2 large eggs, separated

4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted

Cooking spray, for the waffle iron

Strawberry Butter (recipe follows), for serving

Maple syrup, for serving

Strawberry Butter:

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, slightly softened

4 ounces strawberries, hulled and sliced (about 3/4 cup)

A few drops of grenadine syrup","To cook the chicken, put the chicken pieces in a bowl and sprinkle with the salt, pepper, paprika, poultry seasoning, and garlic powder. Add the mustard and use your hands to work everything into the chicken. Pour in the butter­milk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Heat 3 inches of oil to 325oF in a deep cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Combine the flour and Sazonador seasoning in a brown paper bag. Add a few pieces of chicken at a time and shake it like you mean it! Working in batches, fry the chicken until it is beauti-fully brown and crispy on one side, about 15 minutes. Turn and cook until a meat thermometer inserted into the meat registers 160oF, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

To make the waffles, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Whisk the eggnog, egg yolks, and butter in another bowl. Stir the wet ingredi­ents into the dry until combined; you don’t want the batter to be lumpy or too smooth— just right.

Whisk the egg whites until almost stiff; fold them into the batter.

Heat a waffle iron. Spray the waffle iron with cooking spray. Pour some of the batter into the middle of the iron, following the manu­facturer’s instructions. Close and cook until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter.

Top the waffles with fried chicken, Straw­berry Butter, and maple syrup.

For the Strawberry Butter, put the butter in a food processor fitted with the metal blade, and blend until smooth. Add the berries and grenadine and pulse until combined, but with small pieces of berry still visible.","Chicken Mains,Soul Food & Southern,Fried Chicken,Stovetop Chicken,Waffles",https://www.seriouseats.com/melba-wilsons-southern-fried-chicken-and-eggnog-waffles-recipe

1 1/2 tablespoons instant yeast

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar

4 cups bread flour plus extra for flouring work surface

4 tablespoons buttermilk powder

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon salt

1 cup water

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Vegetable oil spray for greasing bowl

2 quarts vegetable oil for frying

2 cups powdered sugar for dusting","In a small saucepan, heat the milk over medium-high heat until small bubbles form along the edges and temperature is between 105 and 110°F. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Whisk in the yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 5 minutes. Mixture should be bubbly.

In a large bowl whisk together remaining sugar, flour, buttermilk powder, baking soda and salt. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture while mixing on low speed to moisten ingredients. Slowly add in the water and vanilla then increase the mixer speed to medium and mix until dough comes together in a ball. Dough will still be wet and tacky.

Spray a large bowl with cooking spray and transfer the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Turn the dough out onto a generously floured work surface, sprinkle the top with flour and roll out into a large rectangle that's approximately 1/3-inch. Use a sharp knife or pizza wheel to cut the dough into 32 approximately 1 1/2-inch squares.

Fill a Dutch oven or deep fryer with 2 inches of oil. Heat oil over medium heat to 350°F. Using a heat-resistant spatula or shallow, heat resistant strainer, carefully drop beignets in the oil. Be careful not to crowd the beignets in the pan (no more than 2 to 3 beignets at a time). After about a minute the dough will begin to puff up, use wooden chopsticks to turn the beignets and fry until deep golden brown on both sides (about 1-2 minutes per side, use the color as your guide keeping a close eye on keeping the oil temperature as constant as possible). Remove doughnuts immediately from the pan using a heat resistant strainer or tongs. Set on paper towel lined baking racks to cool.

Grease four 12-ounce ramekins (or, alternatively, one 8- by 8-inch baking dish) generously with butter or cooking spray, making sure to cover bottoms and sides all the way up to the rims. Dust with an even coating of cornmeal, making sure to cover bottoms and sides all the way up to the rims; tap out excess cornmeal.

In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a medium bowl and using a hand mixer), beat egg whites at low speed until foamy, then increase speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form (or, if at a high altitude, until soft peaks form). Set aside.

Fold the 2 tablespoons cornmeal into the grits along with the cheese, chives, and salt until well combined. Add egg yolks 1 at a time, stirring until each is fully incorporated before adding next.

Working in 3 additions, carefully fold beaten egg whites into the grits mixture just until well combined.

The resulting mixture should be light and airy, not heavy or thin.

Fill prepared ramekins 3/4 of the way full with the grits mixture. Set ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet.

Bake on middle rack until soufflés have risen and are just starting to brown on top, about 30 minutes. Remove carefully and serve immediately. The soufflés should remain risen for about 10 minutes after removing from the oven, and are just as good after they fall.","Sides,Soul Food & Southern,Savory,Cheddar Cheese,Eggs",https://www.seriouseats.com/awendaw-souffle-grits-souffle
White Cake With Brown Butter and Toasted Sugar Recipe,Stella Parks,American,"For the Cake:

21 ounces sugar (about 3 cups; 595g)

12 ounces unsalted butter (about 3 sticks; 340g)

2 tablespoons baking powder

1 1/4 ounces vanilla (about 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons; 35g)

3/4 ounce water (about 4 1/2 teaspoons; 21g)

1 tablespoon (12g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

4 large eggs, brought to about 65°F/18°C (about 7 ounces; 200g)

20 ounces bleached cake flour, such as Swans Down, see note (about 4 1/2 cups, spooned; 565g)

22 ounces milk, any percentage will do (about 2 3/4 cups; 625g), brought to about 65°F/18°C

To Finish:

About 6 cups of frosting, any style","Toast the Sugar: Adjust oven rack to middle position, preheat to 350°F (180°C), and place the sugar in a 10-inch stainless steel skillet. Toast in the oven until fragrant and pale gold, like white sand, stirring thoroughly every 20 minutes or so to circulate sugar away from the edges of the pan. The whole process will take about 1 hour, but it can vary significantly depending on oven temperature accuracy, skillet size and shape, and frequency of stirring. Pour warm sugar into a 2-quart glass baking dish (or similar) to speed cooling and let it cool to approximately 70°F (21°C) before use. The cooled sugar can be used right away, or it can be stored in an airtight container indefinitely.

Brown the Butter: In 3-quart stainless steel saucier, melt butter over medium-low heat until fluid. Increase to medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops; adjust heat as needed, so that dairy solids will not scorch before all the water can boil away. Continue cooking and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form along the pan, until butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent (an indication the water has entirely boiled away). The entire process should take about 15 minutes; substantially shorter or longer times may indicate improper heat settings.

Pour into bowl of a stand mixer (there will be about 9 3/4 ounces or 276g), along with all the toasty brown bits, and cool until thick, creamy, and opaque, or approximately 70°F (21°C). This can be done passively over the course of several hours, or in about 20 minutes with a cold-water bath using a few ice cubes. Alternatively, the brown butter can be refrigerated up to a week in an airtight container and then warmed to about 70°F (21°C) before use.

Getting Ready: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here). If you don’t have three pans, it’s okay to bake the cakes in stages; the batter can be held at room temperature during this time.

For the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combined the cooled brown butter, the cooled toasted sugar, baking powder, vanilla, water, salt, and baking soda. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate; then increase to medium and beat until soft, fluffy, and pale, about 8 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.

With the mixer still running, add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the cake flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before.

When the batter looks smooth, scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula; then fold the batter once or twice from the bottom up to be sure everything is well-combined. The batter should look creamy and thick but not stiff.

Divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 27 ounces or 765g). Stagger pans together on one oven rack and bake until puffed, firm, and pale gold, about 35 minutes. If oven has uneven heat, pause to rotate the pans after about 16 minutes. Alternatively, bake two layers at once and finish the third later.

Cool cakes directly in their pans until no trace of warmth remains and then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment, and return cakes right side up (covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours). Prepare buttercream.

For the Crumb Coat: Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions here) and set scraps aside for snacking. Place one layer on a heavy cast iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with second and third layers and then cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial here). Refrigerate cake until buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.

To Finish: Rewhip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency and then use to finish and decorate the chilled cake as desired. Let the cake sit out until it reaches an internal temperature no cooler than 70°F (21°C) before serving, otherwise it will be too cold and seem greasy and dense. Cut with a chef’s knife to serve and cover exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep the cake moist. Under a cake dome, the frosted cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.","Cakes,Layer Cake,American,Easter Desserts,Mother's Day",https://www.seriouseats.com/white-cake-with-brown-butter-and-toasted-sugar
Classic Rich and Silky Potato Gratin (Scalloped Potatoes) Recipe,Sohla El-Waylly,American,"1 cup (240ml) heavy cream

2 cups (480ml) whole milk

2 small shallots (110g total), quartered

1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

6 sprigs fresh thyme

2 teaspoons (6g) whole black peppercorns

1 1/2 teaspoons (7g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt

3 large russet potatoes (about 30 ounces; 800g)

2 ounces (60g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

4 ounces (120g) grated Gruyère cheese

1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter, softened","In a small saucepan, combine cream, milk, garlic, shallots, nutmeg, thyme, peppercorns, and salt. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 1 hour.

Return milk mixture to boil, then strain into a large heatproof bowl, pressing gently on the solids.

Using a mandoline, slice the potatoes crosswise 1/8 inch thick, directly into the hot milk mixture. Stir the potatoes to fully coat.

Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). In a small bowl, combine the Gruyère and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.

Grease a 2-quart baking dish with the butter. Lay the sliced potatoes in one even layer, then sprinkle with the cheese mixture. Repeat layering potatoes and cheese until all the potatoes have been used and half the cheese mixture remains; leave the top layer without cheese. Pour any remaining milk mixture over the layered potatoes.

Bake until the potatoes have become tender and the surface is lightly golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours.

Homemade Klondike Bars Recipe,Stella Parks,American,"For the Filling:

3 ounces egg whites (from about 3 large eggs; 85g)

3 3/4 ounces sugar (about 1/2 cup; 105g)

1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar, or 1/4 ounce lemon juice (about 1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)

8 ounces heavy cream (about 1 cup; 225g)

2 1/2 ounces milk (about 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 70g), any percentage will do

1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the Chocolate Coating:

7 ounces dark milk chocolate, such as Endangered Species 48%, finely chopped (about 1 cup; about 200g)

3 1/2 ounces refined coconut oil (shy 1/2 cup; about 99g)","Getting Ready: Line an 8-inch-square cake pan with two 8- by 14-inch sheets of parchment paper so that the parchment completely covers the bottom and sides of the pan, with a little excess all around. These flaps will be essential in removing the ""ice cream"" later on; wax paper and tinfoil should not be used.

Prepare a water bath in a wide pot, with a thick ring of crumpled tinfoil set inside to later prevent the bowl from touching the bottom of the pot or the water itself. Place pot over high heat until water is bubbling-hot, then adjust to maintain a gentle simmer.

For the Filling: Combine egg whites, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place bowl over the water bath so it sits on the foil ring (the bowl should not touch the water). Cook, stirring and scraping continuously with a flexible spatula, until egg white mixture reaches 165°F (74°C). This should take about 6 minutes in a metal bowl; if it takes substantially longer, it simply means the heat is too low. If the mixture cooks too fast, or scrambles despite constant stirring, this indicates that the water has come to a boil, or that the water is able to touch the bowl.

When the mixture reaches 165°F, transfer bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed until meringue is glossy, stiff, and thick, about 5 minutes. (The timing will vary depending on the power of a given stand mixer.)

Once meringue is thick and stiff, whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks, as well. (This can be done in a separate bowl by hand or with a hand mixer, or in the original stand mixer bowl if the meringue is transferred to a second bowl; no need to wash the whisk.) Add milk and vanilla to meringue and whisk to combine. Add whipped cream and continue whisking until smooth.

Immediately pour ""ice cream"" mixture into prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Cover with foil (the foil should not touch the ice cream) and freeze overnight or until 0°F (-18°C). Meanwhile, freeze a cutting board large enough to accommodate the pan as well.

Using the excess parchment, tug the chilled ice cream from the pan. Remove one sheet of parchment and place over the surface of the ice cream, then invert ice cream onto the chilled cutting board. Peel off remaining parchment and cut ice cream into 9 squares with a large chef's knife, wiping the blade clean with a paper towel between slices. Drape with a sheet of plastic wrap and return ice cream bars to the freezer until needed. (If this will be longer than 1 hour, be sure to wrap the bars tightly in plastic to prevent odor absorption.)

For the Chocolate Coating: Melt chocolate over a water bath or in a microwave-safe bowl, using two or three 15-second bursts on normal power and stirring well between rounds. Add coconut oil and stir until fully melted and smooth. If any lumps refuse to melt, rewarm briefly and stir until they do. Pour approximately two-thirds of this mixture into a bowl or container approximately 4 1/2 inches wide and 2 1/2 inches deep (see note), and cool to about 80°F (27°C). The time needed for this stage will vary depending on the starting temperature of the coconut oil and melted chocolate.

To Assemble the Bars: When the chocolate has cooled, grab an extra sheet of parchment and remove prepared ice cream bars from freezer. Working with one at a time, use an offset spatula to loosen each bar and transfer to the dish of chocolate coating. Using a fork, dunk each portion under the chocolate, then lift and allow the excess to run off. Transfer to a clean sheet of parchment set on the free edge of the cutting board. This setup will work something like a conveyor belt, as the dipped bars slowly outnumber the un-dipped bars and take up new space on the chilled board.

Continue until all bars have been coated, adding reserved chocolate to dipping bowl as needed. Pause as needed throughout the process to re-freeze the bars if they seem to be melting or softening around the edges.

Freeze the bars until the chocolate coating has fully set, about 15 minutes, then transfer to a gallon-sized, freezer-safe zip-top bag. If you like, the individual bars can be wrapped in a sheet of wax paper or thin decorative foil. Continue freezing until ice cream has fully hardened after its time outside the freezer, about 4 hours more. In an airtight container, the ice cream bars can be kept in the freezer for up to 1 month.

Classic Pecan Pie Recipe,Lauren Weisenthal,American,"One half recipe Easy Pie Dough

3 eggs, beaten

2 tablespoons honey

1 cup light corn syrup

1/4 cup brown sugar

4 tablespoons melted butter, cooled

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon vanilla

3 cups toasted pecans (2 cups roughly chopped and 1 cup left whole)","Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.


Roll pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, salt, and vanilla. Whisk for approximately 30 seconds, until the mixture is homogenous and slightly frothy.





 

Keep whisking until the mixture is homogenous and a little bit frothy. This will help incorporate air into it so that the filling strikes a balance between gooey and light.
.

Line pie crust with chopped pecans, reserving the whole ones. Press down slightly so chopped pecans embed in the dough. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, then gently place the whole pecans in concentric circles on the top, taking care not to press too hard, which will cause the nuts to sink into the filling.

Bake pie for 40 minutes, rotating half way through baking. Continue baking, shielding the exposed nuts with aluminum foil if they threaten to burn. When finished, the filling should by slightly jiggly, but mostly set and puffed slightly, about 1 hour total. Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight before serving.





 

The unfolded foil should fit perfectly over the pecans. Bake the pecan pie in a preheated 375°F oven for a total of 1 hour, checking it halfway through. If the nuts are beginning to darken too much, cover the top of the pie with the foil disk and continue baking until the filling is slightly jiggly and registers between 175 and 180°F on an instant-read thermometer.

24 fresh oysters, scrubbed

Lemon wedges, for serving","In a medium (3-quart) saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat until foaming. Add shallots, sliced celery ribs, fennel bulb, garlic, scallion whites, and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, have released all their liquid, and liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in absinthe. Transfer mixture to food processor bowl.

Process vegetables, scraping down sides of food processor bowl as needed, into a coarse paste, about 30 seconds. Stop processor and add parsley, celery leaves, fennel fronds, and scallion greens to food processor bowl. Continue processing until herbs are broken down and well-combined with vegetable mixture, about 30 seconds. With food processor still running, gradually add remaining 4 tablespoons butter, making sure butter is emulsified into paste before adding more. Stop processor and add panko bread crumbs. Pulse mixture until bread crumbs are fully incorporated. Season to taste with salt, erring on the side of less salt, since the oysters are briny.

Deep-Fried Potato Skins With Crème Fraîche and Smoked Salmon Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,American,"5 Yukon Gold potatoes, ideally about 5 or 6 ounces (140 to 170g) each (though larger potatoes will also work)

Vegetable or canola oil, for greasing the potatoes and deep-frying

Kosher salt

Crème fraîche (or sour cream)

4 ounces (115g) thinly sliced smoked salmon

Dill sprigs, for garnish","Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Rub each potato with a light coat of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until just tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Alternatively, microwave pricked and oiled potatoes until just tender, about 5 minutes.

Let potatoes stand until cool enough to handle, then cut in half across their equators. Using a small spoon, scoop out most of the potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving a layer of potato flesh roughly 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick still attached to the skin. (It's okay if the layer of potato flesh attached to the skin isn't perfectly even; that unevenness can add some good textural contrast to each cup.) If you want the cups to stand up more easily, slice off the very bottom of each one to create a level base. Set potato cups aside.

Using a blender or immersion blender, process scooped potato flesh into a slurry, adding just enough water to form a purée the consistency of applesauce. (You need only enough potato slurry to lightly coat each scooped potato cup, so you may want to purée only a portion of the scooped flesh and reserve the rest for a small batch of mashed potatoes.)

Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. In a 5-quart Dutch oven or large wok, heat 2 1/2 inches oil over high heat until it reaches a temperature of 365°F (185°C). Working in batches, dip each scooped potato cup in the potato slurry to coat it inside and out; allow the excess slurry to drain off, then carefully lower each potato cup into the hot oil. Because the slurry is so wet, the frying will be very vigorous, so be careful not to fry more than a few at a time.

Cook, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, until potatoes just begin to turn lightly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towel–lined baking sheet, inverting each one, concave side down, to allow it to fully drain. Repeat dipping and frying with remaining potato cups. Using a fine-mesh strainer, skim out any free-floating fried bits of slurry from the oil and discard.

When ready to serve, return oil in Dutch oven or wok to 365°F (185°C). Fry potato cups in batches a second time, agitating them with wire mesh spider, until deeply golden brown and crispy all over, inside and out, about 3 minutes. Transfer cups to fresh paper towels to drain and season them with salt on all sides, then turn them concave side down to fully drain.

Once they are cool enough to handle, arrange cups on a plate, concave side up. Fill each with a generous dollop of crème fraîche and top with smoked salmon and a sprig of dill.

1 1/2 cups (8 ounces; 225g) sauerkraut

1/4 cup (3 ounces; 85g) homemade or store-bought cranberry sauce

5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter, softened

8 slices rye bread

8 slices (8 ounces; 225g) Swiss cheese","For the Russian Dressing: In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, ketchup, gravy, pickles, horseradish, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.

For the Sandwiches: Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Lay a sheet of aluminum foil on a rimmed baking sheet and place turkey in the center. Bring foil edges up to form walls, then add stock to turkey. Bring edges of foil together, and crimp seal foil packet. Transfer to oven to heat turkey through, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine sauerkraut and cranberry sauce and set over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, about 5 minutes; cover and keep warm.

Evenly spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Heat a larger cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Working in batches, toast bread, butter-side down, until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer toasted bread slices to a rimmed baking sheet, toasted-side up; allow to cool slightly.

Flip bread slices over, so untoasted sides are facing up. Spread Russian dressing evenly on each slice of bread. If you are finishing sandwiches on a griddle or in a skillet, layer one slice of cheese on each slice of bread. If you are finishing sandwiches in the oven, layer one slice of cheese on only four slices of bread. Divide turkey evenly over four bread slices (for oven sandwiches, use the four slices without cheese), making sure to let any excess stock drip off before arranging on bread. Divide cranberry-sauerkraut mixture evenly over turkey. Layer remaining cheese slices over cranberry-sauerkraut.

If finishing sandwiches in the oven, transfer baking sheet to the oven and bake until cheese is fully melted, about 3 minutes. Close sandwiches, pressing each one together lightly.

Perfect Apple Pie Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"4 to 4 1/2 pounds Golden Delicious, Braeburn, or other baking apples, peeled cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch slices

3 quarts boiling water (or cider, see note)

10 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for sprinkling over crust

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon (or more, to taste)

1/4 teaspoon salt

2 to 4 tablespoons cornstarch (see note)

1 recipe Easy Pie Dough

1 egg white, lightly beaten","Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and place a heavy rimmed baking sheet on it. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place apple slices in a large bowl or pot. Pour boiling water or cider directly over top. Cover and set aside at room temperature for ten minutes. Drain apples well and let sit in a colander in the sink, tossing occasionally until completely dry, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and add 10 tablespoons sugar, cinnamon, salt, and cornstarch, and toss until apples are evenly coated. Set mixture aside.

Roll one disk of pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Add filling, discarding any excessive juices in the bottom of the bowl. Roll remaining disk of pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to top of pie. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of both pie crusts until they overhang the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of both pie crusts down together, tucking them in between the bottom crust and the pie plate and working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges. Cut 5 slits in the top with a sharp knife for ventilation.

Use a pastry brush to brush an even coat of lightly beaten egg white all over the top surface of the pie. Sprinkle evenly with a tablespoon of sugar. Transfer pie to sheet tray in the oven and bake until light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375°F and continue baking until deep golden brown, about 25 minutes longer.

4 1/2 cups (about 18 ounces) grated sharp white cheddar cheese

2 cups (about 8 ounces) grated Gruyère or 1 1/4 cups (about 5 ounces) grated Pecorino Romano cheese

1 pound elbow macaroni","Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter a 3-quart casserole dish; set aside. Place the bread in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Pour the melted butter into the bowl with the bread, and toss. Set the breadcrumbs aside.

Warm the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When the butter bubbles, add the flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.

While whisking, slowly pour in the hot milk a little at a time to keep mixture smooth. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick, 8 to 12 minutes.

Charred Broccoli With Taleggio Cheese Sauce and Gremolata Recipe,Sasha Marx,American,"8 ounces (225g) Taleggio cheese, rind removed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)

1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream

2 heads broccoli (about 2 pounds; 900g)

1/3 cup (80ml) extra-virgin olive oil

1/3 cup (15g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems

1 small green jalapeño (about 1/2 ounce; 15g), stemmed, seeded, and finely minced

1 medium clove garlic, minced

Finely grated zest of 1 lemon

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil, plus more as needed","Place Taleggio in a large heat-proof liquid measuring cup or tall-sided bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream to a simmer over medium-high heat. Pour hot cream over the Taleggio, and immediately cover tightly with plastic wrap. Set aside for 20 minutes; then use an immersion blender or blender to process cheese mixture into a very smooth purée with the consistency of nacho cheese sauce. (The sauce can be thinned to desired consistency with additional hot cream.) Cover and set aside until ready to serve. To reheat sauce, microwave on high heat, stopping and stirring every 15 seconds until it is loosened up and warmed through; be careful not to get it very hot, lest it break.

Using a sharp knife, separate broccoli crowns from stems, just below the point where the florets converge on the stem (this will hold the florets together); reserve stems. Slice crowns lengthwise into 3/4-inch-thick steaks, trimming them such that each piece has two flat sides; set aside. Roughly chop broccoli floret trimmings into small pieces; transfer to small mixing bowl. Trim away bottom ends and tough outer layer of broccoli stems and cut stems into fine dice (following steps 9-12 in this knife-skills guide). Add stems to bowl with chopped floret pieces.

Add olive oil, parsley, jalapeño, garlic, and lemon zest to bowl with stems and florets, and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.

In a large cast iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil over high heat until smoking. Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan, add broccoli steaks, season with salt, and cook, using a small cast iron skillet or weight to press down on broccoli for even charring. Cook until charred on first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn broccoli over, add remaining vegetable oil, and cook until broccoli is charred on second side and stem sections are just cooked through (poke them with the tip of a paring knife or cake tester to test for doneness; they should be firm but tender enough to be pierced without resistance), 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate or baking sheet, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining broccoli.

Warm a large serving plate or individual serving plates. Spread warmed Taleggio sauce in an even layer on the plate(s). Arrange broccoli steaks on top of cheese sauce, and then top with gremolata.

Chiles Rellenos (Mexican-Style Cheese-Stuffed Chilies) Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"For the Salsa Ranchera and Chilies:

6 Poblano peppers

2 pounds Roma tomatoes (1kg; about 6 medium)

1 small yellow onion (about 6 ounces; 170g), split in half, unpeeled

2 to 3 serrano chilies

6 medium cloves garlic, unpeeled

1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock or water

1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves and tender stems (1/2 ounce; 15g)

1 tablespoon (15ml) lard or vegetable oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Filling:

1 tablespoon (15ml) lard or vegetable oil

1 small onion (about 6 ounces; 170g), finely diced

1 teaspoon (about 2g) dried oregano

1/2 pound (225g) fresh Mexican chorizo or ground pork

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

10 ounces (285g) grated Jack, pepper Jack, Chihuahua, or cheddar cheese; 16 ounces (450g) if making smothered version (see note)

To Fry:

2 cups (475ml) vegetable oil

4 large eggs, separated

1 cup flour (5 ounces; 140g), divided","For the Salsa Ranchera and Chilies: Adjust rack to 4 inches below broiler and preheat broiler to high. Place Poblanos, tomatoes, onion, serranos, and garlic on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil until chilies are blackened on top, about 5 minutes. Flip chilies to expose another un-blackened surface and continue broiling for another 5 minutes. Turn chilies one more time, flip tomatoes, and continue broiling until chilies are blackened all over, a few minutes longer.

Transfer tomatoes, onion, garlic, serranos, stock, and cilantro to the bowl of a food processor or blender. Wrap Poblanos with foil from baking sheet and set them aside to steam. Process salsa until smooth but still a little chunky.

Heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) lard or oil in a medium saucepan until just starting to smoke. Immediately pour all of the salsa into pan (it will bubble very violently). Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by about 1/2 cup. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.

For the Filling: Heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) lard or vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened and gently browned, about 4 minutes. Add oregano and chorizo or pork and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Immediately transfer pork mixture to a bowl with grated cheese and toss to combine. Set aside.

Carefully peel chilies without tearing them. Make a slit in one and remove most of the seeds. Spoon cheese/pork mixture into the cavity and carefully close chili back up, slightly overlapping the edges. Repeat with remaining chilies. If you are making the smothered version, you should have about 1 cup of filling left over (see note).

To Fry: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F. Adjust heat to maintain temperature. Whisk egg whites until stiff peaks form. Whisk in yolks one at a time until incorporated (do not over-whisk). Sprinkle with 1/4 cup flour and whisk just until flour is incorporated. Set aside.

Place remaining flour on a shallow plate. Gently pick up one chili and roll it in flour to coat. Transfer to egg mixture and gently turn to coat. (You may have to spoon the mixture over the top if the chili is too fragile.) Using your hands or a flexible fish spatula, carefully slip one chili into hot oil. Repeat until pan is full, making sure not to crowd it. If there are any un-battered spots on the top surfaces of the chilies, dollop a small amount of batter on top to seal them. Cook until the bottom side is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn and cook until second side is browned, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer cooked chilies to a paper towel–lined plate. Repeat until all chilies are cooked.

For the Traditional Version: Spoon salsa into the bottom of a casserole dish. Top with chilies and spoon a little more salsa over them. Serve immediately (or bake in a 375°F oven for a few minutes to reheat if desired).

For the Smothered Version: Spoon salsa into the bottom of a casserole dish. Top with chilies and spoon a little more salsa over them. Spread remaining filling mixture over the top. Bake in a 375°F oven until melted and bubbly, about 10 minutes.

Preheat broiler to high heat and set an oven rack 6 or 7 inches from flame. In a large (12-inch) straight-sided sauté pan or cast iron skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add chorizo and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon, until brown and cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chorizo to a plate and set aside. Drain all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add salsa verde and chicken broth and heat over medium heat until simmering. Add three-quarters of the chips and toss gently to coat. Cover and set aside while you make the eggs.

In a large non-stick pan, cook 4 eggs until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Season with salt. Transfer to a large plate.

Stir in the remaining tortilla chips to the chilaquiles pan and season to taste with salt if necessary. Sprinkle with cheese and the reserved crumbled chorizo. Broil until cheese is melted (if using Jack) and the tops of a few of the tortillas brown, 1 to 3 minutes (if using cotija, the cheese won't melt well, so you can skip this broiling step). Divide onto plates or serve family-style from the skillet, topping with fried eggs, sour cream, pickled red onions, sliced radishes, and cilantro. Serve immediately with lime wedges, for squeezing.","Breakfast & Brunch,Southwestern & Tex Mex,Frying,Fried Eggs,Sausages",https://www.seriouseats.com/chorizo-egg-salsa-verde-chilaquiles-recipe

5 grams (.175 ounces, about 1 teaspoon) rapid-rise yeast

30 grams (1 ounce, about 2 1/4 tablespoons) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing pan

325 grams (11.5 ounces, about 1 cup plus 6 tablespoons) water

For the Sauce:

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

4 cloves garlic, grated on a microplane grater

1 tablespoon dried oregano

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, roughly pureed in a food processor or blender

1 tablespoon sugar

1 shallot or small onion

Kosher salt

1/2 ounce finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese","Combine flour, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Whisk to combine. Add olive oil and water. Knead on low speed just until dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Let dough rest for 10 minutes, then knead once more on low speed for 10 minutes. Dough should pull away from sides of bowl but stick to bottom.

Remove dough hook, cover top of mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 24. Meanwhile, make the sauce.

For the Sauce: Heat olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until butter melts. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, sugar, and whole shallot. Bring to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until rich and thick, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool in fridge while dough rises.

Two hours before baking, remove dough from fridge. Generously grease the inside of a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with olive oil (about 3 tablespoons). Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Form into flat ball and transfer to baking sheet. Using your hands, coat the ball on all sides with olive oil. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic and let dough rise in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough should spread out .

Carefully stretch and push the dough into the corners and edges of the pan. Cover loosely, and let rise for 1 hour longer. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. When dough has risen, gently dock center with finger tips and use your hands to create a risen ridge about 1-inch wide around the edge.

In medium saucepan over medium heat, bring 3 cups chicken broth to a simmer. Add chicken, adding more broth if necessary so that chicken is just covered with liquid. Simmer gently until chicken is just cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate, strain and reserve 1 1/2 cups broth.

When chicken is cool enough to handle, tear into small bite size shreds. Place in bowl and add chili powder, cumin, cayenne, chili sauce, lime zest, lime juice, 1/4 cup reserved chicken broth, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss until well combined and set aside.

American-Style Chocolate Buttercream Recipe,Stella Parks,American,"4 ounces heavy cream (about 1/2 cup; 115g), straight from the fridge

4 ounces finely chopped dark chocolate (not chips), around 72% (about 2/3 cup; 115g)

12 ounces unsalted butter (3 sticks; 340g), softened to about 65°F (18°C)

9 ounces organic powdered sugar (about 2 1/4 cups, spooned; 255g), preferably tapioca-based, such as Wholesome (see note)

3 ounces high-fat Dutch cocoa powder (about 1 cup, spooned; 85g)

2 teaspoons vanilla extract, plus more to taste

3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

3/4 teaspoon instant espresso powder, plus more to taste","In a small saucepan, bring cream to a simmer. Off heat, add chopped chocolate and whisk until smooth. Set aside and cool to approximately 75°F (24°C). This can be done slowly by letting the mixture cool down over time in the saucepan, or sped up by transferring the ganache to a wide, shallow container to increase its surface area; the faster method will cool the ganache in about 30 minutes.

Place butter in the bowl of a stand mixer, then sift powdered sugar and Dutch cocoa on top to ensure no lumps of either remain in the frosting. Fit stand mixer with a paddle attachment and mix on low until dry ingredients are fully incorporated.

Add vanilla, salt, and espresso powder, then increase speed to medium and beat until frosting is creamy and smooth, pausing along the way to scrape bowl and beater as needed. This will take about 6 minutes, although the exact timing will vary depending on the power of the mixer and the temperature of the ingredients.

Reduce speed to medium-low and add ganache. Once ganache is fully incorporated, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a spatula, then resume mixing a few seconds longer to ensure the frosting is homogeneous. Extending the beating time can create a lighter, paler frosting with a higher yield, while reduced beating can create a denser, darker frosting with a lower yield; which you choose depends on your personal preference. At this stage, the buttercream can be doctored to taste with additional salt, vanilla, or instant espresso powder.

Use buttercream right away or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out air, and seal. The buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to several months. (The main issue with longer storage in the freezer is odor absorption, not spoilage.) Bring buttercream to approximately 72°F (22°C) and re-whip before use; see the troubleshooting guide below for tips on adjusting its consistency.

Troubleshooting: If too cold, the frosting may seem stiff, greasy, or curdled; to fix, melt 1/4 cup frosting until liquid, then return it to the bowl and re-whip. Conversely, if too warm, the frosting may seem soft, loose, or runny; to fix, refrigerate the bowl of frosting for 10 minutes, then re-whip. It can take time to achieve the right temperature and consistency, but it gets easier with practice.","Desserts,American,Gluten-free Desserts,Chocolate",https://www.seriouseats.com/chocolate-american-buttercream-recipe

2 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated on a Microplane grater

1/4 cup (30g) flour

Freshly ground black pepper

2 pounds (900g) green beans, ends trimmed, cut into 2-inch segments","Combine shallots and oil in a wok or medium nonstick saucepan. Shallots should barely stick out above level of oil. Place over high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are completely soft, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, line a rimmed baking sheet with 6 layers of paper towels. Continue to cook shallots, stirring constantly, until shallots are light golden brown, about 8 minutes.

Immediately strain through a fine-mesh strainer set in a heat-proof bowl or saucepan. Set shallot oil aside. You should have about 2 cups of fried shallots.

Transfer fried shallots to paper towels. Lift up one end of top paper towel and roll shallots off onto second. Blot with first towel to absorb excess oil. Repeat 4 more times, transferring shallots from one paper towel to the next, until only one paper towel remains. Season well with salt.

Allow shallots to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Once they've cooled, transfer to a sealed airtight container. Shallots can be made up to 1 month in advance.

Smash mushrooms under the bottom of a large skillet until broken into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces. Roughly chop into pieces approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch in size. Set aside.

Combine soy sauce, lemon juice, chicken stock, and heavy cream in a 1-quart liquid measuring cup or medium bowl.

Add 2 tablespoons (30ml) reserved shallot oil (save remainder in an airtight container for another use) and butter to a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Heat over high heat until butter is melted and foaming subsides. Add mushrooms to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms begin to sizzle, 6 to 10 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium-high. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until light golden blond, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, add stock and cream mixture.

Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until mixture achieves a texture between pancake batter and heavy cream, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Light and Thin Pancakes From Homemade Pancake Mix Recipe,Stella Parks,American,"For the Pancake Mix:

4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal blue label (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)

1/2 ounce sugar (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)

1/2 ounce malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Hoosier Hill Farms (about 2 tablespoons; 15g)

1 1/2 teaspoons (6.8g) baking powder

1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

1/4 teaspoon (1.6g) baking soda

2 1/2 ounces refined coconut oil, solid and firm, between 68°F and 72°F (about 1/3 cup; 70g)

For the Pancakes:

6 ounces milk, any percentage will do, or nondairy alternatives (about 3/4 cup; 170g)

1 large egg, straight from the fridge (1 3/4 ounces; 50g)

1/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons ; 7g)

1 batch pancake mix, above (about 1 1/2 cups; 8 1/4 ounces; 233g)","For the Pancake Mix: In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, malted milk powder, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Process about 30 seconds to ensure the leavening agents are fully homogenized into flour.

Add the solid coconut oil and pulse only until it disappears into a dry and powdery mix, just a few seconds. It's important that the coconut oil is fully combined into the flour, while also remaining powdery and dry, so use caution and avoid over-processing, especially with larger batches (a 14-cup food processor can handle a maximum batch size of 4x; plan accordingly for smaller machines). Transfer the mix to an airtight container and store up to one year at or below 74°F, or until the date stamped on the package of coconut oil.

For the Pancakes: Preheat an electric griddle to 350°F, or heat a large, nonstick skillet to a similar temperature on the stovetop. In a large mixing bowl, whisk milk, egg, and vanilla extract until well-combined. Add prepared pancake mix and whisk until smooth, although a few flecks of coconut oil may dot the batter.

With a large scoop, measuring cup, or ladle, divide the thin batter in 1/4-cup portions (or as desired) and griddle until golden brown on either side, and cooked through the middle, about 90 seconds per side. Serve immediately, with butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or whatever other toppings sound fun.

Troubleshooting: The timing and yield of this recipe will vary substantially depending on how the pancake batter is portioned as well as the exact temperature of the griddle itself. When pancakes are excessively browned but raw in the middle, the griddle is likely too hot; when the pancakes are cooked through but too soft and pale, the griddle may be too cool.","Pancakes,American,Stovetop,Quick Breakfast,Mother's Day",https://www.seriouseats.com/light-and-thin-pancakes

Mocha Mascarpone Icebox Cake Recipe,Stella Parks,American,"For the Cookie Layers:

1 batch unbaked Tate's-style chocolate chip cookie dough

For the Filling:

16 ounces mascarpone (about 2 cups; 455g), cold

16 ounces heavy cream (about 2 cups; 455g), cold

3 ounces brown sugar (about 1/3 cup, firmly packed; 85g)

2 ounces bittersweet liqueur (about 1/4 cup; 55g), such as crème de cacao or Kahlúa (see note)

1 ounce high-fat Dutch cocoa powder (about 1/3 cup; 30g), sifted; see our recommended Dutch cocoas here

1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso powder, plus more to taste

1/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g), plus more to taste; see our recommended vanilla extracts here

1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

To Serve:

One 3-ounce chocolate bar

6 ounces heavy cream (about 3/4 cup; 170g)","For the Cookie Layers: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Portion raw cookie dough according to the recipe.

To bake cookies, line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper and trace two 8-inch circles on top, then flip the paper upside down. Arrange 7 portions of cookie dough within each circle, creating a daisy-like pattern. Bake until cookies have spread to fill each circle and turned thin and golden brown, with an even color from edge to center, about 20 minutes. While cookies are still hot, use a knife to gently nudge the soft dough within the bounds of the outlined circles, or trim as needed; reserve any trimmed scraps. Repeat the baking process for a total of 5 cookie sheets. The remaining dough can then be baked as individual cookies, or frozen according to the directions in the original recipe to bake at a later time.

For the Filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine mascarpone, heavy cream, brown sugar, liqueur, Dutch cocoa powder, instant espresso powder, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix on low speed until relatively homogeneous, then increase to medium and whip until mixture is thick enough to hold soft peaks. Taste (preferably using a cookie scrap reserved from trimming) and adjust seasoning as needed with additional salt, espresso powder, or vanilla to taste. Resume whipping on medium speed and continue whipping until cream is thick and stiff, like a frosting. Using your reserved cookie scraps, taste filling and add more salt, espresso powder, or other flavors to taste, if desired.

To Assemble: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch nonreactive, loose-bottom aluminum pan; I use Lloyd Pans' 8""x4"" cheesecake pan. The recipe can also be adapted to a nonreactive springform pan of varying dimensions, although this will require individual adjustments along the way.

Place about 6 ounces (170g) of the whipped filling in the loose-bottom pan and spread it around the sides in an even layer, using an offset spatula. Nestle 1 prepared cookie sheet into the bottom of the pan, pressing gently to ensure it lies flat. (Don't worry if it happens to break or crack.) Top with about 7 1/4 ounces (205g) of prepared filling and spread into an even layer. Repeat with remaining cookies and cream, using up all the remaining cream so that the last cookie has no topping. Cover cake with foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably no longer than 18 hours; chilling beyond this point may cause the cookie layer along the bottom to soften too much to be handled with ease.

To Serve: Just before serving, make a few chocolate curls by running a stick peeler down the long edge of a chocolate bar, with a sheet of wax or parchment paper placed underneath to catch the curls. This works best with milk chocolate at about 70°F (21°C); the chocolate may be too brittle at cooler temperatures and tacky when warmer. Dark chocolate can also be shaved using the same technique, but this tends to work best when the chocolate is a few degrees warmer, as it can be quite brittle for shaving even at 70°F. Whip the heavy cream until it can hold medium-soft peaks.

Let the chilled icebox cake stand at room temperature a few minutes to soften the exterior layer of cream. This will take about 5 minutes at roughly 70°F (21°C), or less time in warmer weather. In cooler months, it may help to briefly wrap the pan in a kitchen towel soaked in hot tap water.

When ready to unmold, place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object (something tall enough to lift the icebox cake at least 4 inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base). With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Slide an offset spatula or a wide, flat cookie spatula under the icebox cake, wiggle to loosen it from the pan, then slide your hand under and transfer the cake to a serving plate. Top with whipped cream and chocolate curls. Cut into wedges using a large chef's knife, rinsing the blade clean under hot running water between slices. Serve immediately.

Serving and Storage Tips: The exact shelf life of this cake will vary with how long it was refrigerated after assembly and before serving, as well as according to personal preference, as the cookies will begin to soften and disintegrate over time. Some may find this messy state of affairs wonderfully soft, while others may consider it mush. Likewise, when the cake is served as soon as possible, the cookies will remain quite toothsome and crisp; for some, this provides the perfect textural contrast, while for others, they may seem too hard.","Icebox Cake,Summer Desserts,American,Chocolate,Desserts",https://www.seriouseats.com/mocha-mascarpone-icebox-cake-recipe

Sous Vide Burgers Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"24 to 30 ounces freshly ground beef chuck

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon vegetable oil (if finishing on stovetop)

4 slices cheese (optional)

4 soft hamburger buns, lightly toasted

Toppings, as desired","Preheat a water bath to desired final temperature using a sous-vide cooker, according to the chart above.

Divide meat into four equal portions and gently shape each one into a patty slightly wider than your buns. Season generously with salt and pepper. Place patties in individual zipper-lock bags. Remove air from zipper-lock bags by closing the bags, leaving the last inch of the top unsealed. Slowly lower into the preheated water bath, sealing the bag completely just before it fully submerges. Cook according to the chart above.

To Finish in a Pan: Remove the burgers from the bags and place them on a paper towel–lined plate. Pat dry very carefully on both sides and season with additional salt and pepper. Let the burgers rest at room temperature for 10 minutes to dry their exteriors. Before searing the burgers, have your toasted buns and condiments ready to accept them. Heat the oil in a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add the burger patties and cook, without moving, until just browned, about 1 minute. Flip the burger and add a slice of cheese to the top surface (if using). Cook until the second side is browned and the cheese is melted, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer. Transfer the burgers to the prepared buns, top as desired, and serve immediately.

To Finish on the Grill: Remove the burgers from the bags and place them on a paper towel–lined plate. Pat dry very carefully on both sides and season with additional salt and pepper. Let the burgers rest at room temperature for 10 minutes to dry their exteriors. Before searing the burgers, have your toasted buns and condiments ready to accept them. Light one chimney full of charcoal (about 5 quarts of coals). When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Scrape the grill grates clean with a grill scraper, then oil the grates by holding an oil-dipped kitchen towel or paper towels in a set of tongs and rubbing them over the grates 5 to 6 times.

Place the burgers directly over the hot side of the grill and cook until a deep, rich crust has formed, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Flip burgers and add cheese (if using). Cook until the second side is browned and the cheese has melted, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer. If the fire threatens to flare up as the burgers drip fat into it, suffocate the fire by closing the grill lid until the flames die out. Alternatively, using a long spatula, transfer the burgers to the cooler side of the grill until the flames subside. Do not allow flames to engulf the burgers. Transfer the burgers to the prepared buns, top as desired, and serve immediately.

Epic New York Cheesecake From BraveTart Recipe,Stella Parks,American,"For the Graham Cracker Crust:

7 ounces graham cracker crumbs, store-bought or homemade, see note (about 1 3/4 cups; 200g)

1 ounce unsalted butter, melted (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)

Pinch of salt

For the Cheesecake:

32 ounces full-fat cream cheese, such as Philadelphia, brought to about 70°F/21°C (about 4 cups; 905g)

8 ounces fresh goat cheese (not pre-crumbled), brought to about 70°F/21°C (about 1 cup; 225g)

1/2 ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)

1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)

1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

1/4 teaspoon orange flower water

14 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 2 cups; 395g)

6 large eggs (about 10 1/2 ounces; 300g)

6 ounces heavy cream (about 3/4 cup; 170g)

To Serve:

16 ounces (volume will vary; 455g) fresh fruit, such as pitted and halved cherries, blueberries, sliced peaches, small strawberries, or some assortment thereof, optional

1 recipe (about 1/2 cup) complementary Fruit Syrup or jelly, for saucing the fruit, optional","Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch non-reactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style; this style can be difficult to find, but this pan was manufactured especially for this recipe. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here.

If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan.

For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan.

For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450°F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.

Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.

In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking.

Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250°F until done; this may take an hour or more.

Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250°F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145°F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more.

Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours.

Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.

Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.

To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit, if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.","Cheesecakes,Cakes,American,Cherry,Summer Desserts",https://www.seriouseats.com/epic-new-york-cheesecake-from-bravetart

1/2 cup water

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Powdered sugar to garnish","Heat oil to 375°F in a large Dutch oven and adjust flame to maintain temperature. While oil is heating prepare the funnel cake batter.

In a large bowl whisk together pancake mix and sugar. Whisk in water and vanilla until you get all the lumps out. Your batter should be the thickness of cake batter, not too thin and not too gloppy. Lifting the batter with the whisk or a spoon should form ribbons as it falls back to the surface.

Pour batter into a funnel or a plastic squeeze bottle with a 1/4-inch opening. You'll use about 1/2 cup of batter per funnel cake. If using a funnel, cover the opening with your finger and position over the center of dutch oven or deep fryer. Allow the batter to flow, working quickly to swirl in a loopy circular pattern to make a 4 to 5-inch large disk. Fry disk for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden on the bottom.

1/4 cup (55g) grated or finely minced low-moisture mozzarella

2 tablespoons (20g) minced red onion

1 tablespoon (15g) finely chopped pickled jalapeño peppers

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Four 1/2-inch-thick slices white, rye, or whole wheat sandwich bread

4 slices Pepper Jack cheese

1 medium (6-ounce; 170g) Hass avocado, halved, pitted, and flesh scooped

4 thin slices tomato","Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large cast iron or nonstick skillet, or using a griddle, cook bacon over medium heat, turning as needed, until well browned and crisp on both sides, about 7 minutes; if possible, use a weight to press bacon flat as it cooks. Transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate, and reserve bacon fat in a heatproof bowl; wipe out skillet.

Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, combine tuna, mayonnaise, panko (if using), mozzarella, red onion, and pickled jalapeños. Stir, mashing very well with a fork or stiff rubber spatula, until well-combined and almost no flakes of tuna remain. Season with salt and pepper.

Using a pastry brush, lightly but evenly brush both sides of each slice of bread with reserved bacon fat. Using the same skillet or griddle, toast bread slices on first side over medium heat until nicely browned and crisp, about 3 minutes; using a cooking weight or spatula, gently press down on bread slices while toasting to ensure even heating and browning.

Flip bread and lay one slice of cheese on top of each bread slice. Mound avocado on 2 of the bread slices, spreading it in an even layer. Top avocado with tuna, spreading it in an even layer, followed by tomato slices and bacon. Close sandwiches, placing top bread slices cheese side down, and continue to cook until bottom of sandwich is well toasted; press down gently on sandwich with cooking weights or a spatula to ensure even heating and browning.

Flip sandwiches and cook until second side is well-toasted. Transfer tuna melts to a baking sheet and heat in oven until cheese is melted through, about 5 minutes. Serve.","Sandwiches,American,Stovetop,Cheese,Tuna",https://www.seriouseats.com/tuna-melt-avocado-bacon-tomato

8 ounces light brown sugar, not dark brown (about 1 cup, firmly packed; 225g)

3 1/2 ounces raw cane sugar, not white (about 1/2 cup; 100g)

2 teaspoons (8g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

1 1/2 teaspoons (8g) baking soda

8 ounces cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch chunks (about 16 tablespoons; 225g)

8 ounces assorted chocolate chips, preferably no darker than 70%, see note (about 1 1/3 cups; 225g)

1 large egg, straight from the fridge, well beaten (1 3/4 ounces; 50g)

1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)","Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, light brown sugar, raw cane sugar, salt, and baking soda. Process until well-combined; add cold butter and pulse to form a dry and powdery mix; comparable results cannot be produced by hand or with a stand mixer. Add chocolate chips and pulse once or twice to combine. This mixture can be refrigerated up to one week in an airtight container or used immediately in the next step.

Transfer the cookie ""mix"" to a large bowl; add egg and vanilla, stir well; the mixture will seem alarmingly crumbly and dry at this stage. Once the wet ingredients have been absorbed, knead mixture by hand until it comes together like classic dough.

Divide into about 56 portions with a 1-tablespoon scoop. If you like, these can be transferred to a zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months; soften to about 68°F (20°C) before baking.

Arrange portions on a parchment-lined half-sheet pan (do not use a silicone mat), leaving about 2 or 3 inches between cookies to account for spread. Bake until thin and golden brown, with an even color from edge to center, about 16 minutes. Cool cookies directly on the baking sheet until room temperature. Transfer to an airtight container and continue cooling an hour more; the cookies will not be fully crisped until then. At cool room temperature, the cookies will keep at least six weeks in an airtight container.","Cookies,American,Chocolate",https://www.seriouseats.com/thin-and-crispy-chocolate-chip-cookies

Kosher salt and freshly ground black or white pepper

3 1/2 ounces (100g) grated Gruyère or Swiss cheese

2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter, divided

2 medium cloves garlic, minced

1 pound (450g) fresh Savoy spinach, thoroughly washed, or 10 ounces (283g) defrosted frozen spinach (see note)","In a medium bowl, season eggs with salt and pepper, then whisk until homogeneous and frothy. Set aside.

Add cheese to a separate medium heatproof bowl, and line a large plate with a double layer of paper towels. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon (15g) butter over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is aromatic and just begins to soften, about 30 seconds.

If using fresh spinach: Add spinach to skillet, cover, and cook until just wilted, about 2 minutes (you may have to press down on the spinach with the lid at first to cover, but the spinach will rapidly lose volume as it wilts). Uncover, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until spinach is very soft and most of the liquid it has released has evaporated, about 4 minutes.

If using defrosted frozen spinach: Add spinach to skillet, season with salt and pepper, and stir well to combine. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, until excess water has evaporated, about 4 minutes.

Transfer cooked spinach to paper towel-lined plate, roll up in the towels, and squeeze gently to extract any additional excess moisture; discard paper towels and any accumulated liquid. Transfer hot spinach to bowl with cheese.

Wipe out now-empty skillet, and melt remaining 1 tablespoon (15g) butter over medium heat, swirling frequently, until butter is lightly browned. Re-whisk eggs until foamy, then add to skillet and cook, using a silicone spatula to push the edges in toward the center as they set and tilting the pan to spread the uncooked egg underneath. Continue pushing in the edges of the eggs and tilting the skillet, working all around the pan, until omelette is almost set, about 45 seconds.

Sprinkle spinach and cheese mixture over half of omelette, remove from heat, cover, and let omelette sit until mostly or fully cooked through on top (depending on your preferred consistency), about 1 minute.

Using silicone spatula, loosen the edges of the omelette from skillet and shake skillet to ensure that it's not stuck. Carefully fold omelette in half to enclose the filling, then slide it onto a serving plate and serve immediately.","American,Stovetop Eggs,Gruyere,Spinach,Breakfast & Brunch",https://www.seriouseats.com/florentine-omelette-spinach-and-cheese

The Food Lab's All-American Meatloaf Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"1/2 cup homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock

1/4 cup buttermilk

1/2 ounce (2 packets; about 1 1/2 tablespoons) unflavored gelatin

2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, crusts removed and torn into rough pieces

4 ounces button or cremini mushrooms, cleaned

3 anchovy filets

1/2 teaspoon Marmite

2 teaspoons soy sauce

1 teaspoon paprika

2 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped (about 2 teaspoons)

1 small onion, roughly chopped (about 3/4 cup)

1 small carrot, peeled and roughly (about 1/2 cup)

1 stalk celery, roughly chopped (about 1/2 cup)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

12 ounces freshly ground pork (see note)

1 1/4 pounds freshly ground beef (see note)

2 large eggs

4 ounces cheddar, provolone, Monterey Jack, or Muenster cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup)

1/4 cup finely minced fresh parsley

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Glaze:

3/4 cup ketchup

1/4 cup packed light brown sugar

1/2 cup cider vinegar

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","Combine the chicken stock and buttermilk in a liquid measuring cup and sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the top. Set aside.

Place the bread and mushrooms in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.

Add the anchovies, Marmite, soy sauce, paprika, and garlic to the processor bowl and pulse until reduced to a fine paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and pulse until finely chopped but not pureed.

Heat the butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the chopped vegetable mixture and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until it is softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes; the mixture should start to darken a bit. Stir in the buttermilk mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms and bread, stir thoroughly to combine, and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.

Add the meat mixture to the bowl, along with the eggs, cheese, parsley, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. With clean hands, mix gently until everything is thoroughly combined and homogeneous; it will be fairly loose. Pull off a teaspoon-sized portion of the mixture, place it on a microwave-safe plate, and microwave it on high power until cooked through, about 15 seconds. Taste the cooked piece for seasoning and add more salt and/or pepper as desired.

Transfer the mixture to a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, being sure that no air bubbles get trapped underneath. (You may have some extra mix, depending on the capacity of your pan; this can be cooked in a ramekin or free-form next to the loaf.) Tear off a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil large enough to line a rimmed baking sheet and use it to tightly cover the meatloaf, crimping it around the edges of the pan. Refrigerate the meatloaf while the oven preheats. (The meatloaf can be refriger- ated for up to 2 days.)

Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F. When the oven is hot, remove the meatloaf from the refrigerator and, without removing the foil cover, carefully invert it onto the rimmed baking sheet. Loosen the foil and spread it out, leaving the pan on top of the meatloaf (see note). Fold up the edges of the foil to trap the liquid that escapes from the meatloaf while baking. Bake until just beginning to set (the top should feel firm to the touch), about 30 minutes.

Use a thin metal spatula to lift an edge of the inverted loaf pan, jiggling it until it slides off the meatloaf easily, and use oven mitts or a folded kitchen towel to remove the pan, leaving the meatloaf on the center of the foil. Return to the oven and bake until the center of the meatloaf registers 140°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes longer. There will be quite a bit of exuded juices; this is OK. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 500°F.

Meanwhile, Make the Glaze: Combine the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, and pepper in a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is homogeneous, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Use a brush to apply some glaze to the meatloaf in a thin, even layer, then return it to the oven and bake for 3 minutes. Glaze again and bake for 3 minutes longer. Glaze one more time and bake until the glaze is beginning to bubble and is a deep burnished brown, about 4 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice and serve with any extra glaze and mustard or ketchup as desired.","American,Roasted Beef,Ground Beef,Pork,Beef Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-all-american-meatloaf-excerpt-recipe

Add dried chilies to a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stockpot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with an intense, roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chilies, place in a small bowl, and set aside. Alternatively, place dried chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until chilies are pliable and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total.

Season short ribs on all sides with salt and pepper. Add oil to Dutch oven and heat over high heat until smoking. Add half of short ribs and brown well on all sides (it may be necessary to brown ribs in 3 batches, depending on size of Dutch oven—do not overcrowd pan), 8 to 12 minutes total, reducing heat if fat begins to smoke excessively or meat begins to burn. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet or plate. Repeat with remaining short ribs, browning them in the fat remaining in Dutch oven. Once all short ribs are cooked, transfer all rendered fat into a small bowl and reserve separately. Allow short ribs to cool at room temperature.

Meanwhile, return Dutch oven to medium-high heat and add 1 cup (240ml) chicken broth, using a flat wooden spoon or stiff spatula to scrape browned bits off of bottom of pan. Reduce heat until chicken broth is at a bare simmer, add toasted chilies to liquid, and cook until chilies have softened and liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chilies and liquid to a blender. Add anchovy, Marmite, soy sauce, tomato paste, ground spices, coffee, and chocolate and blend at high speed, scraping down sides as necessary, until a completely smooth purée has formed, about 2 minutes. Set chili purée aside.

Trim meat from short rib bones and hand-chop into rough 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch pieces (finer or larger, as you prefer), reserving bones separately. Add any accumulated meat juices to chili purée.

Heat 4 tablespoons (60ml) rendered beef fat (if necessary, add vegetable oil to reach 4 tablespoons) in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add fresh chilies, garlic, and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chili purée and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pot, until chili mixture begins to fry and leaves a coating on bottom of pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Add chicken stock, chopped beef, beef bones, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting, add beans, and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans are almost tender, about 1 hour. Add crushed tomatoes and cider vinegar and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans and beef are fully tender and broth is rich and lightly thickened, 2 to 3 1/2 hours longer, adding water if necessary to keep beans and meat mostly submerged (a little protrusion is okay).

Using tongs, remove and discard bay leaves and bones. (At this point, any excess meat still attached to the bones can be removed, chopped, and added back to the chili, if desired.) Add vodka (or bourbon), hot sauce, and brown sugar and stir to combine. Season to taste with kosher salt, ground black pepper, and additional vinegar.

Serve immediately, or, for best flavor, allow to cool and refrigerate overnight, or up to 1 week in a sealed container. Reheat and serve with desired garnishes.","Chili,Southwestern & Tex Mex,Cannellini & Kidney Beans,Short Ribs,Beef Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chili-recipe

Lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl. Slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the eggs in a steady stream, whipping the eggs as you pour. If you want, add that glug of bourbon now.

Sour cream, shredded cheese, and salsa, for serving, if desired","For the Fajita Marinade: Combine soy sauce, lime juice, oil, brown sugar, cumin, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic in medium bowl and whisk to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup (120ml) marinade to a separate vessel and set aside.

For the Steak: Place steaks in a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and add remaining marinade. Seal bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Massage bag until meat is fully coated in marinade. Lay flat in refrigerator, turning every couple of hours, for at least 3 and up to 10 hours.

For the Fajitas: When ready to cook, preheat broiler and position over rack to highest position. If you have a baking steel or stone, set iton the top rack and allow to preheat. If using a baking steel/stone, set a rimmed baking sheet on it to preheat as well; otherwise leave the baking sheet at room temperature.

Remove steaks from marinade and blot dry with paper towels. Arrange steaks in an even layer on rimmed baking sheet. Broil, without flipping, until steaks are well charred on top side, about 4 minutes. Broiler strength and oven designs vary greatly, so cooking times will vary as well; keep a close watch. If your broiler heats unevenly, you may need to move the sheet tray around for more even browning. If not using a baking steel or stone, flip steaks and broil for 30 seconds longer (steaks cooked with the help of a baking steel/stone do not need to be flipped and cooked longer). Remove from oven and transfer steaks to a platter to rest.

Switch oven from broil mode to 450°F (230°C). Add red, yellow, and green bell peppers as well as onions to baking sheet. Pour reserved 1/2 cup of marinade all over and toss until evenly coated; using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits on the baking sheet. Arrange peppers and onion in an even layer that covers the baking sheet from edge to edge, then cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and browned in spots, about 25 minutes (if your oven heats from the top, you will want to cook the vegetables on a middle rack to avoid excessive scorching and burning). If you're using a baking steel/stone, you can cook the vegetables on it, but keep a closer eye since they run the risk of scorching on the bottom; if this begins to happen, move the sheet pan to another rack.

Slice steak into thin strips across the grain; then add back to sheet pan with any juices. Return to oven to warm through; if steaks need additional cooking, leave them an additional minute or two until they've reached the desired doneness.

Serve immediately with hot tortillas, guacamole, pico de gallo, and other condiments, as desired.","Skirt Steaks,Southwestern & Tex Mex,Roasted Beef,Beef Mains,Game Day",https://www.seriouseats.com/sheet-pan-skirt-steak-fajitas

Sicilian Pizza With Pepperoni and Spicy Tomato Sauce Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"For the Dough (see note):

17.5 ounces bread flour (500g; about 3 1/2 cups)

1/2 ounce salt (14g; about 1 tablespoon)

1/4 ounce instant or rapid-rise yeast (6g; about 1 1/2 teaspoons)

0.35 ounce extra-virgin olive oil (20g; 2 tablespoons), plus 1/4 cup olive oil (60ml; 40g) for the pan

11.5 ounces room-temperature water (325g; about 1 cup plus 7 tablespoons)

For the Sauce:

2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil

9 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped

1 tablespoon (about 4g) dried oregano

2 teaspoons (about 3g) dried red pepper flakes, or more to taste

1 (28-ounce; 800g) can whole peeled tomatoes

1 teaspoon (about 4g) sugar

Kosher salt

To Assemble and Bake:

1 pound (450g) sliced deli-style mozzarella cheese

12 ounces (325g) natural-casing pepperoni, cut into 1/8-inch slices (see note)

4 ounces (115g) ground Pecorino Romano cheese","To Make the Dough in a Food Processor (recommended): Combine flour, salt, yeast, 0.35 ounce olive oil, and water in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade or dough blade attachment. Process until a dough that rides around the blade forms, then continue processing for 30 seconds. Continue with Step 4 below.

To Make the Dough in a Stand Mixer: Combine flour, salt, yeast, and 0.35 ounce olive oil in the bowl of a stand mixer (see below for mixer-free version). Whisk to combine. Fit mixer with dough hook attachment. Add water to mixer and mix on medium speed until dough comes together and no dry flour remains. Increase speed to medium-high and mix until dough is stretchy and smooth, about 6 minutes. The dough should stick to the bottom of bowl, but pull away from the sides. Continue with Step 4 below.

To Make the Dough Using the No-Knead Method: Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Add 0.35 ounce olive oil and water and stir by hand until dough comes together and no dry flour remains. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. Continue with Step 4 below.

Pour remaining 1/4 cup olive oil into a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet and spread over entire inner surface with your hands. Transfer dough to baking sheet and turn in oil until thoroughly coated. Spread gently with your hands. (It will not stretch to fill the pan; this is fine.) Cover baking sheet with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature until dough has slackened and started to spread out toward the edges of the pan, 2 to 3 hours. Carefully remove plastic wrap from pizza dough. Using oiled hands, and working as gently as possible to maintain air bubbles, push and stretch dough into the corners of the pan by pressing out from the center, lifting each corner, and stretching it beyond the edge of the pan. It should pull back until pan is just filled with dough. Set aside for 20 to 30 minutes while you make the sauce.

For the Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until softened and aromatic, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes. Using a pastry cutter or a potato masher, break up tomatoes into fine chunks. Stir in sugar. Bring to a bare simmer and allow to cook for about 15 minutes to let flavors meld. Season to taste with salt. Set aside and allow to cool slightly.

Thirty minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 550°F.

To Assemble and Bake: Spread slices of mozzarella cheese evenly over surface of pizza. Spoon sauce on top of cheese and spread with the back of a spoon. (You will not need all the sauce; use as much as you like, but be sparing.) Spread pepperoni slices evenly over surface. Sprinkle with half of Romano cheese. Transfer to oven and bake until pepperoni is crisp and curled and bottom of pizza is golden brown when you peek by lifting the corner with a thin spatula, about 10 minutes. With some ovens, you may need to loosely tent the top of the pizza with aluminum foil and continue baking until the bottom is golden and crisp.

Remove pizza from oven. Sprinkle with remaining half of Romano cheese, use a pizza wheel to cut it into slices, and serve immediately.","Pizza,Italian-American,Savory,Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/spicy-spring-sicilian-pizza-recipe
Detroit-Style Pan Pizza Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"For the Dough:

300g bread flour (10.5 ounces; about 2 generous cups)

5g instant yeast (0.15 ounce; about 1 teaspoon), such as SAF Instant Yeast

9g salt (0.3 ounce; about 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt or 1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt)

220g water (7.75 ounces; about 1 cup minus 1 1/2 teaspoons)

Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed

For the Sauce:

2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil

3 medium cloves garlic, minced

2 teaspoons (about 5g) dried oregano

Dash red pepper flakes

1 (28-ounce; 800g) can high-quality crushed tomatoes

1 teaspoon (about 6g) granulated garlic powder

1 teaspoon (about 6g) granulated onion powder

1 tablespoon (about 15g) sugar

Kosher salt, to taste

To Finish:

12 ounces (340g) Brick cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see note)

12 ounces (340g) high-quality natural-casing pepperoni, such as Boar's Head or Vermont Smoke & Cure, cut into 1/8-inch slices (optional)","To Make the Dough in a Stand Mixer: Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir to combine, then add water. Mix on low speed until dough comes together into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for 10 minutes. Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky ball, about 10 minutes longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads rather than riding around the edges.) Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

To Make the Dough in a Food Processor: Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add water, then turn on processor and process until dough forms a ball that rides around the bowl of the processor, about 30 seconds. Continue processing for 30 seconds longer. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

To Make the Dough by Hand: Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to combine, then add water and stir with a wooden spoon until a rough ball of dough has formed. Set aside for 10 minutes. Turn dough out onto a countertop and knead until a smooth, silky ball has formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in half if using cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in oil. Press down on dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be able to get it all the way to the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then cover tightly in plastic and set aside for 30 minutes to allow dough to relax. Return to dough and stretch it out again. It should be able to reach the edges this time. If not, let it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into place. Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make the sauce.

For the Sauce: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C), or as close to it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.

To Form the Pizza: Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove any large air bubbles. Lay half of pepperoni (if using) evenly over face of dough. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very edges of the pan, then add remaining pepperoni. Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You will need only about half the sauce—save the rest for another pizza.)

Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese on top is starting to lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a trivet or folded kitchen towel on countertop.

Run a thin metal spatula all the way around the edges of the pan to loosen the pizza. Carefully lift it out and slide it onto a cutting board. Cut pizza and serve.","Pizza,Midwestern",https://www.seriouseats.com/detroit-style-pizza-recipe

One 4 1/2-ounce (130g) tube concentrated tomato paste or 6-ounce (170g) can tomato paste

One 14 1/2-ounce (411g) can whole peeled tomatoes

1 cup (240ml) heavy cream

1 pound (450g) short tubular pasta, such as rigatoni or penne

1/4 cup (60ml) vodka, plus more if desired

2 ounces (55g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving","In a large (3- or 4-quart) saucepan or small Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and red pepper flakes, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are very soft but not browned, about 15 minutes; lower heat if needed to prevent browning.

Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until tomato paste is fragrant and thick, about 3 minutes. Stir in canned tomatoes with their liquid. Bring to a simmer, then cook, stirring often and crushing the whole tomatoes roughly with a spoon, until sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.

Add cream, and stir to incorporate. Transfer sauce to a blender, and blend until very smooth (you may be able to make an immersion blender work, but in our tests the sauce level was too low to safely avoid splattering). Wipe out pot, then return blended sauce to it. Season lightly with salt.

In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until just shy of al dente, about 3 minutes less than the package directs. About 1 minute before you transfer pasta to sauce, add vodka to tomato sauce and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat.

Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer pasta directly to sauce pot along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta water (alternatively, reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain pasta in a colander, then add to sauce with 1/2 cup of the reserved water). Increase heat to high, and cook, stirring constantly, until pasta is well coated in sauce and reaches the al dente stage, about 3 minutes. If sauce thickens too much before pasta is ready, add more pasta water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed. [Shown here with one serving size.]

Remove from heat and stir in cheese until thoroughly incorporated into a smooth and creamy sauce. Taste for salt, and season with more if needed. If you can't detect the vodka at all, you can add a few drops more and stir it in before serving; exactly how boozy you want the sauce is a question of taste, but be careful because a heavy hand will ruin the dish. Spoon pasta and sauce onto warmed serving plates and top with additional grated cheese.

1 (4- to 5-pound; 1.8 to 2.25kg) piece beef chuck roll

Dill pickles, sliced yellow onion, and white bread, for serving","Combine pepper and salt in a small bowl. Rub mixture evenly over surface of chuck roll. Secure chuck roll with 2 to 3 pieces of twine, tied around its circumference at 1- to 1 1/2-inch intervals.

Light 1/2 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to medium-high heat, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate.

Place chuck roll on cooler side of grill. Add 4 to 5 hardwood chunks to hotter side of grill. (If using a gas grill, wrap wood chunks loosely in aluminum foil before placing over hotter side of grill.) Cover and allow beef to smoke, adjusting vents and adding coals a few at a time or adjusting the knobs on a gas grill as necessary to maintain a temperature between 275 and 300°F (135 and 149°C) and adding 2 to 3 wood chunks twice during cooking. Smoke until a deep, dark bark has formed and internal temperature registers between 150 and 165°F (66 and 74°C), about 4 hours.

Remove beef from grill and wrap tightly in a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return to cooler side of grill and continue cooking, adding coals or adjusting knobs to maintain internal grill temperature between 225 and 250°F (107 and 121°C). Alternatively, you can transfer foil-wrapped chuck to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and finish in a preheated 225°F (107°C) oven indoors. (Warning: This will make your whole house smell strongly of smoke.) Cook until meat is almost completely tender and a fork inserted and twisted shows little resistance, 5 to 5 1/2 hours longer. Remove foil, return to grill or oven, and continue cooking until a crisp bark forms, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat, transfer to a cutting board, tent with foil, and allow to cool until internal temperature drops to between 140 and 165°F (60 and 74°C) before serving, 30 minutes to 1 hour.

To serve, slice meat in half with its grain, running knife in between the two largest muscle groups to separate them. Discard twine and place the two halves cut side down on the cutting board.

Slice meat thinly against the grain, using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife. Serve beef with sliced onion, pickles, and white bread. For best results, slice only what you are serving. Remaining chuck can be wrapped in foil and stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Divide mixture in half. Rub half of mixture evenly all over pork shoulder, pressing it in until it adheres. Place pork shoulder in a sous vide–safe vacuum-sealer bag. Add liquid smoke (if using) and seal bag.

To Cook: Set your precision cooker to 165°F (74°C) for more traditionally textured pulled pork, or 145°F (63°C) for sliceable but tender pork. When the bath is at temperature, add sealed bag with pork and cover with foil or plastic wrap. Allow to cook for 18 to 24 hours. After this stage, pork can be refrigerated for up to 1 week before continuing.

To Finish in the Oven: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F. Remove pork from sous vide bag and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (The liquid from the bag can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Rub reserved spice mixture into the surface of the pork.

1/4 cup (60ml) apple cider vinegar

3/4 teaspoon (3ml) Wright’s or Colgin liquid hickory smoke

For the Ribs:

2 whole racks St. Louis–cut pork ribs

About 3/4 teaspoon (3ml) Wright’s or Colgin liquid hickory smoke","For the Spice Rub: Working in batches, combine the paprika, brown sugar, salt, Prague Powder (if using), mustard seed, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, coriander seed, and red pepper flakes in a spice grinder and reduce to a fine powder.

For the Sauce (if using): Combine 3 tablespoons spice rub, grated onion, ketchup, mustard, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and liquid smoke in a medium saucepan and whisk to combine. Bring to a bare simmer and cook until reduced and thickened, about 20 minutes. Set aside.

Prepare the Ribs: Remove the papery membrane on the back of the ribs, using a paper towel or kitchen towel to grip it and pulling it away in one piece. Divide each rack of ribs into three to four portions with three to four ribs each by cutting through the meat in between the ribs. Rub ribs generously on all sides with the remaining spice rub mixture. (Set aside 3 tablespoons spice rub if making dry-style ribs.)

Place individual portions of rubbed ribs in vacuum bags. (Fold over the top of each bag while you add the ribs so that no rub or pork juices get on the edges of the bags, which can weaken the seal.) Add 4 drops (about 1/8 teaspoon) liquid smoke to each bag. Seal the bags, transfer to refrigerator, and let rest for 4 to 12 hours.

When Ready to Cook: Set your precision cooker to 145°F (63°C) for extra-meaty ribs or 165°F (74°C) for more traditionally textured ribs.

Add ribs to the water bath and cover it with a lid, aluminum foil, or table tennis balls. Cook for 36 hours at 145°F or 12 hours at 165°F. Transfer cooked ribs to a large bowl of water filled with ice to chill thoroughly. Ribs can be stored in the refrigerator at this stage for up to 5 days before finishing.

To Finish Dry-Style in the Oven: Remove ribs from vacuum bags and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Rub with remaining 3 tablespoons spice rub. Adjust oven racks to upper and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil and place a wire rack in each. Divide ribs evenly on racks, facing up. Transfer ribs to oven and cook until a crusty bark has formed, about 40 minutes. Serve.

To Finish Dry-Style on the Grill: Remove ribs from vacuum bags and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Rub with remaining 3 tablespoons spice rub. Light one-half chimney full of charcoal (about 2 1/2 quarts of coals). When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the medium heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Scrape the grill grates clean with a grill scraper, then oil the grates by holding an oil-dipped kitchen towel or paper towels in a set of tongs and rubbing them over the grates 5 to 6 times. Place the ribs, facing up, over the cooler side of the grill. Cover and cook until ribs are heated through and dry to the touch, about 15 minutes. Transfer ribs to hotter side of grill and continue grilling, turning occasionally, until a crusty bark has formed, about 10 minutes. Serve.

To Finish Sauced Ribs in the Oven: Remove ribs from vacuum bags and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Adjust oven racks to upper and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil and place a wire rack in each. Divide ribs evenly on racks, facing up. Transfer ribs to oven and cook until surface is sizzling and ribs are heated through, about 20 minutes. Brush ribs with sauce and return to oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, brush with another layer of sauce, and return to oven until sauce is dried and sticky, about 10 minutes longer. Remove ribs from oven, paint with one last layer of sauce, and serve, passing extra sauce at the table.

2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper

1 tablespoon ground white pepper

2 1/2 tablespoons sweet paprika

2 tablespoons granulated garlic

2 tablespoons granulated onion

1 tablespoon dried thyme

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 teaspoon dried basil

1 teaspoon celery seed

8 medium mirlitons (chayotes) (about 4 1/2 pounds total weight)

Stuffing

3/4 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

1 teaspoon Basic Creole Seasoning Blend

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus about 5 tablespoons

1 yellow onion, chopped

2 celery stalks with leaves, finely diced

1/4 large green bell pepper, seeded and chopped

1/4 cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley

3 tablespoons finely chopped green onions, white and tender green parts

2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic

1/2 cup very fine dried bread crumbs, plus about 5 tablespoons

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

1 large egg, lightly beaten","Make the creole seasoning: Combine all the ingredients for the seasoning in a blender or food processor and process until thoroughly mixed. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container for up to 4 weeks.

Prepare the mirlitons: Put the mirlitons in a 3-gallon pot, or two large stockpots, and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot(s) and continue boiling, just until the mirlitons are fork tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the heat and, using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer the mirlitons to a colander to drain and cool.

Once cool enough to handle, place the mirlitons on a cutting board or other flat surface. Cut them in half lengthwise. With a paring knife, shallowly trim away any spiny or blemished spots from the skin, and tough pulp from the end nearest to the seed. Remove and discard the seed and use a small spoon to carefully remove the pulp from the inside of each half, leaving a 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick shell. Drain the mirliton pulp in a colander, lightly squeezing it to release excess moisture, then chop the pulp. Set aside the pulp and shells.

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

To make the stuffing: Season the shrimp with the Creole seasoning and cayenne, mixing well. Set aside. In a heavy 5-quart saucepan or large Dutch oven over low heat, melt the 1/2 cup of butter. Add the onions and cook until they start to soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the celery, bell pepper, parsley, green onions, and garlic, and cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add the reserved mirliton pulp and cook for 6 minutes. Put 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs into a small bowl.

Once the mirliton pulp mixture has cooked for 6 minutes, add 2 tablespoons of the reserved bread crumbs, mixing thoroughly, then continue adding 2 tablespoons at a time until you have added all of them, stirring thoroughly between additions.

Cook the mixture over low heat, until it is noticeably dryer but still moist, about 3 minutes, stirring as needed. Next, add the seasoned shrimp, salt, and pepper.

Continue cooking until the shrimp turn pink, about 1 minute more, stirring almost constantly. Remove from the heat and stir in the egg, blending well.

Mound the stuffing in the 16 mirliton shells, using it all. Place the stuffed shells in a baking pan, such as a 12-by-17-inch baking pan, that will hold the shells in a single layer touching each other lightly to help support their shapes as they cook. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon more bread crumbs evenly over the top of each stuffed shell and center a scant 1 teaspoon butter on the top of each. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake in the hot oven for 10 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the tops are browned, about 1 hour more. Serve at once.

Note: To make ahead, prepare through the point of stuffing up to 1 day in advance. Cover the stuffed mirlitons tightly and refrigerate. Bake as directed when ready to serve.","Roasted Vegetables,Cajun & Creole,Shrimp",https://www.seriouseats.com/stuffed-mirliton-from-treme-cookbook

1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh juice from 1 lemon

2 tablespoons mixed minced fresh herbs, such as parsley, chives, and tarragon, plus more as garnish","In a large saucepan, combine 5 cups (1.2L) stock with reserved shrimp shells and mushroom trimmings. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Strain and return stock to saucepan.

Meanwhile, combine shrimp, 3/4 teaspoon (3g) salt, baking soda, and cornstarch in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.

Whisk grits into stock, set over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer, whisking frequently. Lower heat to a bare simmer and cook, stirring and scraping bottom frequently with a wooden spoon, until grits are fully softened and cooked and have thickened into a spoonable porridge, about 1 hour. Stir in Gruyère cheese until fully melted. Season with salt and pepper and keep grits warm. (A piece of parchment pressed against the surface will help prevent a skin from forming.)

In a large skillet, heat bacon over high heat until sizzling. Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring, until bacon has rendered its fat and become crisp, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. You should have 1/4 cup rendered bacon fat in the skillet. Remove all but 1 tablespoon fat and reserve.

2 1/4 cups (540g) buttermilk

1/2 cup (130g) Frank's RedHot hot sauce

1 teaspoon (4g) garlic powder

1 teaspoon (4g) onion powder

1/2 teaspoon (2g) freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons (8g) kosher salt (see note)

2 pieces (2g) star anise

1 black cardamom pod (2g), inner seeds only

One 2-inch piece cinnamon (4g)

1 teaspoon (2g) cumin seeds

1 tablespoon (5g) Sichuan peppercorns

2 tablespoons (6g) porcini mushroom powder

To Serve (Optional, but Recommended!):

Buttermilk Vanilla Waffles","To Prepare and Brine the Chicken: Using a chef's knife, break the chicken down into 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and 2 wings and divide each breast half in half (making 4 breast pieces in total); leave all pieces bone-in. Split backbone crosswise into 2 pieces and reserve the neck if you choose to fry it as well. (Both the backbone and the neck are optional pieces with very little meat, but fried-chicken-crust lovers will adore them.)

In a large lidded container or mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Add chicken to buttermilk brine, making sure it is fully coated and submerged; cover with lid or plastic wrap. Alternatively, you can place the brine and chicken in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag and place the bag in a dish to catch any leaks. Place in refrigerator and marinate overnight for at least 8 hours and no more than 12 hours.

For Frying: Fill a 12-inch cast iron skillet with oil. (If using a skillet of a different size, increase or reduce the amount of oil to fill it halfway up.) Attach a clip-on thermometer and preheat the oil to 325°F (163°C), keeping the burner at medium-high heat. Line one sheet tray with paper towels and set a wire rack in another sheet tray.

Whisk together the 00 flour and salt. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of buttermilk brine into the flour and gently toss. Working with one piece of chicken at a time, lift chicken from buttermilk and immediately place it in flour with your ""wet"" hand. Using your other, ""dry"" hand, bury the chicken and press flour into all sides, packing tightly to form large clumps of flour coating each piece. Lift chicken out of flour and shake to remove any loose flour before placing into the hot oil. Proceed with remaining pieces, first frying the legs and thighs in one batch, then frying the breast, wings, and backbone (if using) in the second.

Once the chicken is added to the oil, the temperature will drop to between 250 and 275°F (121 and 135°C). Do not increase the heat to compensate; just allow the oil temperature to gradually return to 325°F (163°C) as the chicken cooks. The temperature should be up to 300°F (148°C) after 10 minutes; if not, increase the heat. Fry, turning, until deeply golden brown all over, with extra-dark bits where the chicken makes contact with the pan, about 8 minutes per side for legs and thighs and about 6 minutes per side for wings, breasts, and backbones.

As each piece of chicken is ready, remove from oil to the paper towel–lined sheet tray and season immediately with kosher salt. Transfer chicken to wire rack to rest.

Meanwhile, for the Honey-Butter Drizzle: Add honey to a 1-quart saucepan and caramelize over medium-high heat until deep, nutty brown, with an aroma of burnt sugar. Remove from heat and add water. Return to heat and add butter, stirring until incorporated. Set aside.

For the Spice Dust: Remove stems and seeds from chilies by cutting them open with kitchen shears over a wire rack set over a sheet tray. In a small sauté pan over medium heat, toast chilies until fragrant, warm to the touch, and pliable. Set aside. In the same pan, toast star anise, cardamom, and cinnamon for 30 seconds before adding cumin and Sichuan peppercorns. Toast until fragrant and warm to the touch. In a spice grinder, grind toasted chilies and spices together until fine. Mix in mushroom powder. Set aside.

To Serve: Just before serving, drizzle each piece of chicken with honey butter and generously sprinkle on spice dust. Serve with buttermilk waffles, if desired.","Fried Chicken,Chicken,Soul Food & Southern,Whole Chicken,Buttermilk",https://www.seriouseats.com/extra-crispy-fried-chicken-with-caramelized-honey-and-spice

1 tablespoon baking powder

1 teaspoon salt

1 cup milk

1/4 cup honey

1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) cold unsalted butter","Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a small bowl, combine the milk and honey. Stir until it is completely combined.

Cut the butter into chunks and add it to flour. With a pastry cutter or two knives, cut the butter into the flour until it's the size of small peas. Add the milk and honey mixture to the flour and mix gently just until there are no dry spots.

Flour your work surface and turn the dough out. Pat it into a rough rectangle, then roll it until it's about 1/2 inch thick. Fold it in thirds, like a letter, and roll it again. Fold in thirds again. This time, roll it again to about an inch thick. With a 3-inch biscuit cutter, cut as many biscuits as you can. Re-roll the scraps and cut more biscuits. You can re-roll a third time, but I usually use the final scraps for a free-form biscuit.

Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, If you like soft sides, place the biscuits so they touch. If you want the sides more crisp, keep them separated. If you like, brush the top of the biscuits with milk, butter, or cream.

Chicken-Fried Chicken With Cream Gravy Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"For the Chicken:

2 tablespoons paprika

2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons garlic powder

2 teaspoons dried oregano

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 4 ounces each), or 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 8 ounces each), cut and pounded into 4 cutlets (see note)

1 cup buttermilk

1 large egg

1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 cup cornstarch

1 teaspoon baking powder

4 cups vegetable shortening or peanut oil, for frying

For the Cream Gravy:

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 small onion, finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)

2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 cup whole milk

3/4 cup heavy cream

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","For the Chicken: Combine the paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl and mix thoroughly with a fork.

One at a time, sandwich each piece of chicken between two pieces of plastic wrap or inside an opened zipper-lock bag and pound with a meat pounder or the bottom of a heavy skillet until approximately 1/4 inch thick.

Whisk the buttermilk, egg, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture in a large bowl. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the contents and coat the chicken evenly.

For the Gravy: When ready to fry the chicken, make the gravy: Heat the butter in a 10-inch heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium-high until foamy. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 4 minutes (lower the heat if the butter starts to brown). Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until fully absorbed, about 1 minute. Add the milk in a thin stream, whisking constantly. Add the cream, whisking, and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly. Simmer, whisking, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and plenty of pepper. Keep warm while you fry the chicken.

Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt, and the remaining spice mixture in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of the marinade from the zipper-lock bag and work it into the flour with your fingertips. Remove the chicken from the bag, allowing the excess buttermilk to drip off. Drop the chicken into the flour mixture and toss and flip until thoroughly coated, pressing with your hand to get the flour to adhere in a thick layer. Shake the chicken over the bowl to remove excess flour, then transfer to a large plate.

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 175°F. Heat the shortening or oil to 425°F in a wok or 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, about 6 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature, being careful not to let the fat get any hotter.

Carefully lower 2 pieces of chicken into the pan. Adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 325°F for the duration of cooking. Fry the chicken pieces without moving them for 2 minutes. Carefully agitate the chicken with a wire-mesh spider or tongs, making sure not to knock off any breading, and cook until the bottom is a deep golden brown, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip the chicken and continue to cook until the second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer.

Transfer the chicken to a paper towel–lined plate to drain for 30 seconds, flipping once, then transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 2 pieces of chicken.

Southern Foodways' Mississippi Delta Hot Tamales,Caroline Russock,American,"For the meat filling:

6 to 8 pounds boneless meat (pork shoulder, chuck roast, or chicken)

¾ cup vegetable oil

¼ cup chili powder

2 tablespoons paprika

2 tablespoons salt

2 teaspoons black pepper

1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

1 tablespoon onion powder

1 tablespoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon ground cumin

For the corn husks:

1 to 2 packages dried corn husks

For the masa dough:

8 cups maseca (masa mix) or yellow cornmeal

4 teaspoons baking powder

2 teaspoons salt

1⅔ cups lard or vegetable shortening

6 to 8 cups warm meat broth (from cooking the meat)","To make the meat filling: Cut the meat into large chunks and place in a large, heavy pot. Cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the meat is very tender, 2 to 21⁄2 hours. Remove the meat and reserve the cooking liquid. When the meat is cool enough to handle, remove and discard any skin or large chunks of fat. Shred or dice the meat into small pieces. There should be about 14 to 16 cups of meat. Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Stir in the chili powder, paprika, salt, pepper, cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin. Add the meat and stir to coat with the oil and spices. Cook, stirring often, until the meat is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside.

To prepare the corn husks: While the meat is cooking, soak the husks in a large bowl or sink of very warm water, until they are softened and pliable, about 2 hours. Gently separate the husks into single leaves, trying not to tear them. Wash off any dust and discard any corn silks. Keep any shucks that split to the side, since two small pieces can be overlapped and used as one.

To make the masa dough: Stir the maseca, baking powder, salt, and lard together in a large bowl until well blended. Gradually stir in enough warm broth (from cooking the meat) to make soft, spongy dough that is the consistency of thick mashed potatoes. The dough should be moist but not wet. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth.

To assemble the tamales: Remove a corn husk from the water and pat it dry. Lay the husk on a work surface. Spread about 1⁄4 cup of the masa in an even layer across the wide end of the husk to within 1 inch of the edges. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture in a line down the center of the masa. Roll the husk so that the masa dough surrounds the filling and forms a cylinder or package. Fold the husk under to close the bottom and complete the package. Place the completed tamales in a single layer on a baking sheet. Repeat until all the masa and filling is used. Simmer or steam the tamales.

To simmer: Stand the tamales upright, closed side down, in a large pot. Place enough tamales in the pot so that they do not fall over or come unrolled, or tie the bundle together with kitchen twine. Carefully fill the pot with enough water to come just to the top of the tamales, trying not to pour water directly onto the tamales. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the masa is firm and pulls away from the husk easily and cleanly, about 1 hour.

To steam: Stand the tamales upright, closed side down, in a large steamer basket. Cover the tamales with a damp towel or additional husks. Steam the tamales over simmering water until the masa is firm and pulls away from the husk easily and cleanly, about 1 to 11⁄4 hours. Serve the tamales warm, in their husks.","Beef Mains,Mexican,Corn,Soul Food & Southern Cuisine",https://www.seriouseats.com/cook-the-book-mississippi-delta-hot-tamales-recipe

2 teaspoons salt

2 cups heavy cream, divided

1 to 1/2 cups half and half

3 tablespoons melted butter, cooled slightly

2 pints washed blueberries

1/2 cup granulated sugar

2 tablespoons cornstarch, or tapioca starch

zest of 1 lemon","Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Whisk to combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.

Add one cup heavy cream and one cup half and half. Gently fold the liquid into the dry ingredients, taking care not to work the dough.

Add additional half and half in small drizzles as needed, until the dough is slightly sticky. Some dry spots are OK; it is important not to over-work the dough.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Dust the top with flour, and gently press the dough into a flat circle with your fingers, about 1 inch thick.

Use a floured cutter to cut the dough into shapes.

Cut the shapes as close together as you can to get the most out of the dough piece.

Push what is left after you've cut your first round of shapes back together. Do not fold or mix. Finish cutting the dough.

Rub the lemon zest and 1/2 cup of granulated sugar together between your fingers, then whisk the cornstarch into the sugar mixture.

Toss the blueberries in the sugar mixture, then put them in your baking dish or evenly distribute them between six ramekins.

Top the blueberries with the cream biscuits. The biscuits may be placed so they are almost touching one another.

Brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter, then sprinkle with granulated sugar.

Place the baking dish or ramekins on a baking sheet (very important! the blueberries will bubble over and create a mess) and bake until the tops of the biscuits are golden brown and the blueberries are bubbling all over, rotating halfway through. For ramekins the total time is approximately 20 minutes, and for baking dishes the total time is approximately 30 minutes.

4 cloves of garlic, minced

1 15-oz. can, or two cups cooked, of kidney beans

Cilantro, roughly chopped, for garnish","Remove the stems, membranes, and seeds from the chiles. The membranes carry most of the heat, so leave as much or as little in as your heat tolerance likes. If you're using dried chiles, toast them till fragrant. Add them to a small pot with just enough water to cover, bring it to a boil, and let it cook, covered, for 20 minutes or until very soft.

Purée the chiles with just enough water to keep your blender moving. When you have a very smooth paste, push it through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of any errant fibers or seeds.

Return the strained paste to the blender and add the cheese, lemon juice, and sugar. Blend till smooth, then add salt to taste. The cheese is pretty salty, so add salt with care.

Add the oil to a pot on medium-high heat, and cook the garlic, stirring often, till lightly browned.

Add the sauce. Let it fry for a minute or two and then add the beans. Cover and cook the beans on medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, or until they bind with the sauce.

2 tablespoons (30ml) white vinegar

2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable or canola oil

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (5 to 7 ounces/140 to 200g each), cut into 8 cutlets

For the Sauce:

3 whole jalapeño chilies, roughly chopped (see note)

1 tablespoon (15ml) ají amarillo pepper paste (optional; see note)

1 cup (1 ounce) fresh cilantro leaves

2 medium cloves garlic

1/2 cup (120ml) mayonnaise

2 teaspoons (10ml) fresh juice from 1 lime

1 teaspoon (5ml) distilled white vinegar

1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

To Serve:

Four sturdy buns, such as telera or ciabatta

2 ripe avocados, halved, pitted, and flesh scooped

Thinly sliced red onion

Crisp lettuce leaves, such as romaine","For the Chicken: In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and salt until a smooth, sticky paste forms. Add cumin, paprika, black pepper, and vinegar and grind them together to form a paste. Drizzle in vegetable oil while grinding (see note). Transfer chicken and marinade to a large bowl and massage with your hands until all the chicken is coated in the marinade. Set aside at room temperature while you make the sauce, or cover and place in the fridge up to overnight.

For the Sauce: Combine jalapeños, ají amarillo (if using), cilantro, garlic, mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and vinegar in the jar of a blender. Blend on high speed, scraping down as necessary, until smooth. With blender running, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sauce will be quite loose at this point, but will thicken as it sits. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use.

To Cook: Light 1 chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.

Place chicken directly over the hot side of the grill, cover, and cook, rotating the pieces occasionally (but not flipping them), until the chicken is almost completely cooked through and only a few pink spots remain on the top side, about 4 minutes. Flip chicken and cook on second side until just done, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a large plate.

To Assemble: Place buns cut side down over the hot side of the grill and cook, moving and rotating them occasionally, until well toasted and starting to char, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large cutting board. Use a fork to mash half an avocado on each bottom bun. Sprinkle with a little salt. Top with red onions, lettuce, and 2 pieces of chicken each.

1 1/3 lb (600 g) sea bass fillet (or other white fish), skinned and trimmed

Amarillo Chili Tiger's Milk (above)

A few cilantro sprigs, leaves finely chopped

1 limo chili, seeded and finely chopped

1 sweet potato, cooked and cut into small cubes

Fine sea salt","To make the tiger's milk: Put the fresh ginger, garlic, cilantro sprigs, and the lime juice in a bowl. Stir and then leave to infuse for 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a sieve into another bowl. Add salt and amarillo chili paste and mix well. This will keep for 4 hours in the fridge.

To make the ceviche: Rinse the onion and then leave it to soak in iced water for 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly, spread out on a paper towel or a clean kitchen towel to remove any excess water and then place in the fridge until needed. This will reduce the strength of the onion and help to keep the slices crisp.

Cut the fish into uniform strips of around 1 1/4 by 3/4 inch (3 by 2 cm). Place in a large bowl, add a good pinch of salt, and mix together gently with a metal spoon. The salt will help open the fish’s pores. Leave this for 2 minutes and then pour over the tiger’s milk and combine gently with the spoon. Leave the fish to “cook” in this marinade for 2 minutes.

Add the onion, cilantro, chili, and sweet potato to the fish. Mix together gently with the spoon and taste to check that the balance of salt, sour, and chili is to your liking.

Two 5-ounce (140g) cans tuna in olive oil, drained (or 10 ounces/280g shredded roast chicken meat)

One-quarter of a 12-ounce white onion, finely minced (about 1/3 cup minced)

1/2 cup homemade or store-bought mayonnaise (4 ounces/110g), plus more if desired

Diced poached shrimp, sliced avocado, pitted black olives, minced fresh herbs (such as chives), diced or thinly sliced seeded tomatoes, or other ingredients to garnish your causa","Bake, microwave, or boil the potatoes until you can slide a fork easily through them. Let cool just slightly, then scoop out the flesh and, using a ricer or food mill, mash the potatoes into a large heatproof mixing bowl.

Meanwhile, if using frozen aji amarillo peppers, in a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add frozen peppers, remove from heat, and let steep 5 minutes. Stem and seed peppers (wear gloves if possible, as peppers are spicy), then blend the flesh without any additional liquid until a smooth and even paste forms. (Extra aji amarillo paste can be stored in the refrigerator with a layer of oil poured on top for up to 2 weeks).

Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) homemade or store-bought aji amarillo paste to potatoes, along with the oil, and 4 tablespoons (60ml) lime juice. Season with salt. Fold together until evenly incorporated, then taste. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) lime juice, if desired. Press plastic directly against the surface of the mashed potatoes and refrigerate until chilled.

In a medium mixing bowl, stir together tuna (or chicken), onion, and mayonnaise until evenly mixed. Season with salt. Keep chilled.

When ready to assemble, lay down an even roughly 1-inch layer of mashed potatoes in the bottom of a 2-quart casserole dish; alternatively, you can build the causa on individual serving plates using a ring mold to help form it into a neat cylinder.

Next add a roughly 1-inch thick layer of the tuna or chicken salad. If adding other ingredients like diced, poached shrimp or diced avocado, layer them in either above or below the tuna or chicken salad.

Top with a final layer of the mashed potatoes. You can garnish the top of your causa with whatever you want, including pieces of black olive, sliced or diced tomato, fresh minced herbs, sliced or diced avocado, pieces of shrimp, et cetera.

Keep chilled until ready to serve. The causa in the casserole can be refrigerated overnight.

2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons garlic powder

2 teaspoons dried oregano

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1 cup buttermilk

1 large egg

Kosher salt

One whole chicken, about 4 pounds, cut into 10 pieces or 3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on breasts, legs, drumsticks, and/or wings

1 1⁄2 cups all-purpose flour

1⁄2 cup cornstarch

1 teaspoon baking powder

4 cups vegetable shortening or peanut oil","Combine the paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix thoroughly with a fork.

Whisk the buttermilk, egg, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture in a large bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss and turn to coat. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to overnight, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the contents and coat the chicken evenly.

Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt, and the remaining spice mixture in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of the marinade from the zipper-lock bag and work it into the flour with your fingertips. Remove one piece of chicken from the bag, allowing excess buttermilk to drip off, drop the chicken into the flour mixture, and toss to coat. Continue adding chicken pieces to the flour mixture one at a time until they are all in the bowl. Toss the chicken until every piece is thoroughly coated, pressing with your hands to get the flour to adhere in a thick layer.

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the shortening or oil to 425°F in a 12-inch straight-sided cast-iron chicken fryer or a large wok over medium-high heat. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature, being careful not to let the fat get any hotter.

One piece at a time, transfer the coated chicken to a fine-mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour. Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Once all the chicken pieces are coated, place skin side down in the pan. The temperature should drop to 300°F; adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 300°F for the duration of the cooking. Fry the chicken until it’s a deep golden brown on the first side, about 6 minutes; do not move the chicken or start checking for doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off the coating. Carefully flip the chicken pieces with tongs and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 4 minutes longer.

Transfer chicken to a clean wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, season lightly with salt, and place in the oven. Bake until thickest part of breast pieces registers 150°F (65.5°C) on an instant-read thermometer, and thigh/drumstick pieces register 165°F (74°C), 5 to 10 minutes; remove chicken pieces as they reach their target temperature, and transfer to a second wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, or a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately—or, for extra-crunchy fried chicken, proceed to step 7.

Place the plate of cooked chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and up to overnight. When ready to serve, reheat the oil to 400°F. Add the chicken pieces and cook, flipping them once halfway through cooking, until completely crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet to drain, then serve immediately.","Fried Chicken,Chicken,Soul Food & Southern,Frying,Chicken Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-southern-fried-chicken-recipe

1/2 teaspoon filé powder, plus more as needed for serving (optional; see note)

Warm rice, thinly sliced scallions, and hot sauce, for serving","In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season chicken all over with salt. Working in batches, sear chicken until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter, then set aside until cool enough to handle. Once chicken has cooled, shred into bite-size pieces.

Add sliced andouille to pot and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a platter and set aside.

Add remaining 1 cup (235ml) oil to Dutch oven along with flour, stirring to form a paste. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping frequently, until roux is a chestnut or chocolate-brown color but not scorched, about 1 hour. Alternatively, you can combine the flour and 1 cup oil in a separate ovenproof vessel and cook, uncovered, in a 350°F (180°C) oven, stirring occasionally, until roux is chestnut or chocolate-brown, about 4 hours, though how long this will take can vary dramatically depending on your oven. You can add the finished oven roux to the pot on the stovetop after removing the sausage, then immediately proceed to the next step of sautéing the aromatics.

Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and season lightly with salt. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring and scraping, until softened, about 10 minutes; lower heat to medium if any of the ingredients threaten to scorch.

Peruvian Fried Seafood Platter With Lime-Marinated Onion and Tomato Salad (Jalea) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,American,"For the Salsa Criolla:

1/2 large red onion, very thinly sliced

2 medium plum tomatoes, diced

1/4 cup loosely packed chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems

1 fresh aji amarillo pepper, stemmed, seeded, and minced (see note)

1 medium clove garlic, minced

1/4 cup fresh juice from 3 limes

Kosher salt

For the Fried Seafood:

1 1/2 to 2 quarts peanut, canola, or vegetable oil

4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided

3/4 cup cornstarch

1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1/2 teaspoon paprika

2 cups light beer, divided

1/2 pound skinned and boned firm white-fleshed fish, such as halibut, wild striped bass, or cod, sliced into 1 1/2- by 1-inch pieces

1/2 pound shelled and deveined large shrimp

1/3 pound cleaned squid bodies and tentacles, bodies sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch rings

To Serve:

1 recipe Fried Yuca With Spicy Mayo, for serving","For the Salsa Criolla: In a large bowl, toss onion, tomatoes, cilantro, aji amarillo, garlic, and lime juice together until well combined. Season with salt. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until onions soften slightly and turn a brighter pink color, about 10 minutes. Drain well.

For the Fried Seafood: Preheat oven to 400°F. In a fryer, medium pot, or wok, heat oil to 350°F, adjusting heat source as needed to maintain temperature.

Meanwhile, add 1 1/2 cups flour to a large bowl with corn starch, baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, and paprika. Whisk to combine. Add 1 1/2 cups beer, whisking to form a thick batter; some small lumps of flour are okay. In a separate medium bowl, add remaining 3 cups flour.

Dredge white-fleshed fish in flour, shake off excess, and transfer to beer batter, turning to coat. Working 1 piece at a time, pick up the fish and allow excess batter to drip back into the bowl (a wire strainer can be helpful with this). Return it to the bowl with dry flour and quickly coat it on both sides. Repeat with remaining fish. Pick up the fish pieces with your hands, tossing them gently in your open fingers to get rid of excess flour. Carefully lower into the hot oil and fry, agitating and turning frequently, until golden brown outside, about 3 minutes. Transfer fish to large paper towel-lined mixing bowl and season with salt, shaking gently to absorb oil. Transfer fish to a wire rack set over a baking sheet.

Increase oil temperature to 375°F, adjusting heat to maintain temperature. Repeat dredging and battering process with shrimp and fry until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the large mixing bowl lined with fresh paper towels and season with salt, shaking gently to absorb oil. Transfer shrimp to wire rack with fish.

Whisk remaining 1/2 cup beer into batter until thoroughly incorporated (this will thin the batter slightly, making the squid easier to work with). Repeat dredging process with squid, making sure to drain each piece well of batter before the final coating in flour. Fry until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the same large mixing bowl once again lined with fresh paper towels and season with salt. Shake gently to absorb excess oil.

To Serve: If fried seafood has cooled, set in oven until reheated, about 3 minutes. Mound fried seafood on a plate. Arrange Salsa Criolla on top and serve immediately with fried yuca and its dipping sauce.","Seafood Mains,Peruvian,Halibut,Squid,Shrimp",https://www.seriouseats.com/jalea-peruvian-fried-seafood-salsa-criolla-recipe

1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter

8 top-split hot dog buns, preferably Pepperidge Farm brand

1/4 cup finely sliced scallion greens or chives

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","Kill each lobster by pressing the tip of a heavy chef's knife in the crack just behind the eyes in the center of the carapace. Press down firmly, then split head in half. Using kitchen towels, twist off tail and claws (including knuckles) from carapace. Save carapace for another use. Press each tail flat against the cutting board and insert wooden skewers along their entire length to keep them straight.

Place a steamer insert in the bottom of a large lidded stock pot and add 1-inch of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add a single layer of lobster claws and legs (about half the lobster) and cover pot. Let steam for exactly two minutes. Transfer lobsters to sink and set under running cold water. Return liquid to a boil and repeat with remaining lobster tails and claws.

As soon as lobster is cool enough to handle, remove meat from shell using kitchen shears, lobster crackers, and/or the back of a heavy cleaver to help crack the shells (It's OK if the meat gets a little mangled). Roughly chop into bite-sized pieces and set on double layer of paper towels to drain.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a heavy bottomed 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl to coat pan. Add four buns with one cut side down. Cook, pressing on buns gently and moving them around the pan until golden brown on first side. Remove from pan, add another tablespoon of butter, and toast second side. Repeat with second batch of buns.

Melt remaining butter in skillet over medium heat. As soon as butter is melted, add lobster meat. Cook, tossing constantly and using a spoon to gently fold meat and butter over itself int he skillet until lobster is mostly opaque (butter should not sizzle), about 3 minutes.

2 ounces bacon, finely diced

3 large shallots, minced (about 1 cup)

3 medium cloves garlic, minced

Pinch red pepper flakes

1/4 cup dry white wine

24 littleneck clams, purged and scrubbed (see note)

1/2 cup minced flat-leaf parsley, divided

2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter, softened

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Lemon wedges, for serving","For the Bacon Bread Crumbs: In a large skillet, cook 6 ounces diced bacon over medium-high heat, stirring, until fat has rendered and bacon is browned and crisp, about 7 minutes. Lower heat if skillet gets too hot and begins to smoke.

Stir in bread crumbs to evenly coat in bacon fat and cook, stirring and tossing, until bread crumbs are lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool. Season very lightly with salt and pepper.

For the Clams: In a large sauté pan, cook 2 ounces diced bacon over medium-high heat until fat has rendered and bacon is lightly browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until shallots have softened, about 4 minutes.

Add white wine and clams, cover, and cook, checking occasionally, until the clams begin to open. Using tongs, transfer opened clams to a large bowl to cool, continuing to cover sauté pan and checking frequently for newly opened clams. Continue until last clams have opened. (Some may open only a crack; this is fine, just pry the shell fully open.)

Uncover sauté pan and cook, stirring, until wine and clam liquid have evaporated and the shallot-bacon mixture has become jammy. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

In a medium bowl, stir shallot-bacon mixture and 1/4 cup parsley into softened butter until thoroughly incorporated. Season lightly with salt and pepper. (Clams can be salty, so be careful not to over-season.)

Working one at a time, pry off top shell of each clam and discard, making sure no shell fragments from hinge fall into clam. Free each clam from bottom shell, then set back in bottom shell and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.

Using a butter knife, pack clam butter all around and over each clam, sealing each into the bottom shell. Sprinkle a small amount of bacon bread crumbs on top of each clam, pressing lightly to adhere. At this point, you can cover the baking sheet with plastic and refrigerate clams for up to 1 day before cooking. (You will have clam butter left over; keep it refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 1 week. It's delicious tossed with spaghetti for an easy weeknight meal.)

When ready to serve, place clams in a 450°F oven and cook until butter is melted and clams are fully heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir remaining 1/4 cup parsley into bread crumbs, then sprinkle a generous amount on top of each clam. Return to oven for 1 minute to warm bread crumbs, then serve right away with lemon wedges.","Clams,New England,Bacon,Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/clams-casino-recipe
Pure and Simple Slow-Cooked Boston Baked Beans Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,American,"1 pound dried small white beans (about 2 cups; 450g), such as navy beans

Kosher salt

Assorted peeled, halved, and trimmed aromatic vegetables (such as 1 yellow onion, 1 carrot, and 2 cloves garlic), optional

2 sprigs of a woodsy herb (such as rosemary, sage, and/or thyme), optional

1 bay leaf

1/2 cup (120ml) dark molasses (not blackstrap)

2 teaspoons (10ml) Dijon or brown mustard

Freshly ground black pepper

1/2 pound (225g) salt pork or slab bacon, rinsed of excess salt if necessary and cut into 1/2-inch chunks (see note)

1 large yellow onion, diced (about 8 ounces; 225g) (see note)

Apple cider vinegar, to taste (optional)","In a medium bowl, cover beans with cold water by several inches and stir in 1 tablespoon (15g) salt. Let beans soak at least 12 hours and up to 1 day. Drain and rinse.

Combine beans with aromatic vegetables and herbs (if using) and bay leaf in a large pot and cover with water by several inches. Add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, topping up with water as necessary, until beans are fully tender, about 45 minutes. Using tongs, discard vegetables and aromatics.

Meanwhile, pour molasses into a 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Add mustard, a very generous dose of freshly ground black pepper (let it rain!), and a pinch of salt.

Drain beans, reserving cooking liquid. Add enough bean-cooking liquid to molasses mixture to bring the volume up to 2 cups (475ml) and stir until molasses is completely dissolved. Reserve remaining bean-cooking liquid.

Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). In a Dutch oven, cook pork over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered and pork is beginning to lightly brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring, until onion is very tender and just beginning to turn golden, about 6 minutes. Add beans to pot.

Add bean water/molasses mixture and stir well to combine. Add enough reserved bean-cooking water to just barely cover beans, then stir once more, leveling out beans so that none are sticking up above the liquid level. Bring to a simmer.

Transfer beans to oven and bake, uncovered, until beans are extremely tender but still mostly whole, with only a small fraction beginning to burst, about 4 hours. Check beans once or twice per hour during baking, adding remaining bean-cooking liquid (switching eventually to boiling water if you run out) as needed to prevent the beans on the surface from drying out. Stir beans twice during the baking process to submerge the top ones, leveling them out each time; over time, a dark, browned crust will form on the surface of the beans (this is good). The goal throughout is to keep the liquid level just high enough that the upper beans don't desiccate, but not so high that the surface doesn't brown. Stop adding liquid during the last hour of baking unless the level becomes perilously low.

Remove beans from oven and stir them very well. The sauce should form into a thickened, starchy glaze. If it's too dry, add boiling water sparingly until a glaze is achieved; if it's too wet, simmer briefly on the stovetop until reduced to desired consistency. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If beans are too sweet for your taste, a small splash of cider vinegar can help balance the flavor (though I never thought my beans needed it).

Keep warm until ready to serve. Beans can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Reheat in a saucepan, adding water gradually as needed to loosen them back up.","New England,Braised & Stewed Beans,White Beans,Beans Sides,Fall Sides",https://www.seriouseats.com/boston-baked-beans-recipe

Water, for sealing the spring rolls

Garlic Vinegar Dipping Sauce, for serving

Pineapple Sweet and Sour Sauce, for serving","Heat a large wok or sauté pan over high heat until a drop of water sizzles and evaporates on contact. Swirl the oil into the pan and then add the onion and stir-fry until the onion wilts and begins to lightly brown, 2–3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic just begins to brown, 1–2 minutes. Stir in the ground pork and cook for 1 minute, using a spatula or wooden spoon to break the meat into small pieces. Add the fish sauce, black pepper, carrot, bean sprouts and peas and stir to combine. Continue cooking until the meat is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, 3–4 minutes.

Transfer the cooked filling to a fine-mesh sieve set over a large bowl and set aside. Draining the filling helps to prevent soggy spring rolls, allow the filling to drain and cool completely. After the filling has cooled, discard any liquid that has accumulated in the bowl and then transfer the filling into the same bowl.

To roll the lumpia: Place 1 spring roll wrapper on a clean, dry work surface so that one corner of the wrapper is pointing at you (positioned like a diamond, rather than a square). Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling just under the midpoint of the diamond, closest to the corner pointing at you.

Take the corner closest to you and roll it up and over the filling, until half of the wrapper remains. Fold the left and right corners of the wrapper over the filling. Using your fingers, or a pastry brush, dab the edges of the wrapper with water, and then continue to roll the lumpia toward the final corner at the top.

Place the finished lumpia aside, underneath a moist towel, and continue rolling until all of the filling has been used. (To freeze the lumpia, place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in the freezer until completely frozen. Transfer the frozen lumpia to a large resealable food storage bag and store in the freezer for up to 3 months.)

To fry the lumpia: Fill a large frying pan with at least a 1/2 in (1.25 cm) of vegetable oil. Heat over moderately high heat until the oil reaches 350°F (175°C) on a deep fry thermometer. Alternatively, you can drop a small piece of lumpia wrapper into the hot oil; if it sizzles and immediately begins to brown, the oil is hot enough and ready for frying.

When the oil is ready, fry the lumpia in batches, being careful to not overcrowd the pan. Fry the lumpia, turning occasionally, until golden and crisp, 3–4 minutes total. If frying frozen lumpia, add 1 minute of cook time to each side. Transfer the fried lumpia to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon fresh calamansi juice, or fresh lemon juice

Fresh calamansi limes, or fresh lemon wedges, for squeezing over the sardines","Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large oven-proof sauté pan over moderately high heat. Add the shallot, garlic, dried red pepper flakes, and paprika and cook until the shallot becomes soft and translucent, 3-5 minutes.

Toss the cherry tomatoes into the pan and sauté until the tomatoes soften and have released some of their juices, 5-7 minutes.

Pour the wine into the pan, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the water and fish sauce and simmer until the liquid reduces and thickens a bit, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and set aside.

Season the sardines, inside and out, with the salt and black pepper. In a large bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil with the calamansi (or lemon) juice.

Remove the sardines from the bowl and arrange them in a single layer on top of the tomato sauce in the sauté pan. Place the pan underneath the broiler and broil for 10-12 minutes, flipping the fish over once. The sardines are ready when the skin is nicely browned and crisped, and the thickest part of the fish easily flakes from the tip of a knife.

Balinese Pork Satay (Sate Babi) With Sweet Soy Glaze and Peanut Sauce Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,American,"For the Spice Paste:

One (1-inch) knob fresh turmeric, peeled (about 10g), or 1 teaspoon (4g) ground turmeric

2 stalks lemongrass, bottom 4 inches only, outer layers and root removed, thinly sliced (about 80g)

8 medium cloves garlic, sliced (about 60g)

2 small shallots, sliced (about 75g)

3 whole dried pasilla or guajillo chilies, stems and seeds removed, roughly chopped (about 40g)

2 tablespoons (about 30g) palm sugar or brown sugar

2 teaspoons (about 6g) whole coriander seed

1 tablespoon (about 9g) whole white peppercorns

Kosher salt

2 pounds (1kg) boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3/4-inch cubes

For the Glaze:

1 cup kecap manis (8 ounces; 240ml); see note

1/4 cup sugar (about 2 ounces; 50g), plus more if needed

One (2-inch) knob ginger, roughly chopped

4 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped

For the Dipping Sauce:

10 ounces roasted peanuts (285g; about 1 1/2 cups)

1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable or canola oil, divided

1 ounce (30g) tamarind pulp, soaked and strained (see note), or 2 teaspoons (10ml) tamarind concentrate

1 tablespoon (15ml) kecap manis or fish sauce

Water, as necessary

Sugar, to taste","For the Spice Paste: Combine turmeric, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chilies, sugar, coriander, white peppercorns, and 2 teaspoons (8g) kosher salt using a mortar and pestle, working in batches if necessary. Pound into a fine paste. (For an easier method, pound with the mortar and pestle until a rough paste is formed, then transfer to a food processor to reduce to a fine paste. I do not recommend using the food processor alone if you want maximum flavor.) Divide mixture into thirds.

Combine pork and one-third of spice paste in a large bowl and toss with your hands until all of pork is thoroughly coated in the mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes or up to overnight. Thread pork onto skewers. To do this efficiently, cut an onion or potato in half and place it on your cutting board. Place a piece of pork on top of it and push through it with the skewer. Repeat until each skewer has about 6 inches of pork threaded onto it. Pork should be pushed together quite tightly. Discard onion half (or grill it) after use. Keep pork skewers refrigerated until ready to cook.

For the Glaze: Meanwhile, combine kecap manis, sugar, ginger, and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook until glaze is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in one-third of spice paste and adjust seasoning with more sugar as necessary. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, using the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids. Leftover glaze can be stored indefinitely in a covered container in the refrigerator.

For the Dipping Sauce: Pound peanuts with the mortar and pestle until reduced to a rough powder. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add remaining third of spice paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add peanuts, tamarind juice, remaining oil, kecap manis or fish sauce, and 1/2 cup (120ml) water. Stir to combine. Once liquid comes to a simmer and turns creamy, adjust consistency with more water as necessary to produce a creamy sauce that just barely flows. Season to taste with a little sugar if desired. Leftover sauce can be stored for several weeks in a covered container in the refrigerator.

To Cook: Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.

Working in batches as necessary, place pork directly over hot side of grill. Immediately start fanning coals or flames with a large piece of cardboard or with the hose of a Shop-Vac to prevent flare-ups. Cook, fanning constantly and turning pork occasionally, until pork is cooked through and browned on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Transfer pork to cooler side of grill and brush on all sides with glaze. Return to hot side of grill and cook, turning, just until glaze starts to bubble and get sticky, about 45 seconds. Transfer skewers to a serving platter and repeat until all pork is cooked.

Brush pork with another layer of glaze just before serving and serve with peanut sauce on the side or spooned on top.","Grilled Pork,Indonesian,Peanuts,Pork Shoulder,Pork Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/indonesian-balinese-pork-satay-sate-babi-soy-glaze-peanut-recipe

Cambodian Lemongrass Chicken Stir-Fry (Cha Kreung Satch Moan) Recipe,Elazar Sontag,American,"For the Kreung:

3 stalks lemongrass, bottom 4 to 5 inches only, outer leaves discarded, sliced into thin rounds (65g once sliced)

One 3-inch knob galangal, peeled and sliced into thin rounds (35g once sliced)

Two 4-inch knobs fresh turmeric, peeled and sliced into thin rounds (25g once sliced)

12 makrut lime leaves, preferably fresh, sliced very thinly crosswise

1 small shallot, peeled and sliced into thin rounds (25g once sliced)

5 medium cloves garlic, peeled (25g)

1/2 cup holy basil leaves, very tightly packed (12g; see note) or Thai basil leaves (25g)

For the Stir-Fry:

1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil, divided

2 pounds (900g) boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 3 breast halves), cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices, divided

One 3-inch piece fermented mudfish (35g), cut in half, divided (optional; see note)

2 teaspoons (10ml) Asian fish sauce, divided

1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar, divided

1/2 cube (6g) chicken bouillon, such as Knorr, crumbled to a powdery consistency, divided

1 cup holy basil leaves, very tightly packed (40g), divided

4 jalapeños (150g), stemmed, halved, and seeded, then cut on a bias into 3/4-inch strips, divided

Kosher salt

For Serving:

Steamed white rice","For the Kreung: Using a large granite mortar and pestle, combine lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, and makrut lime leaves and grind to a smooth but slightly fibrous paste. These are the toughest, most fibrous ingredients in the paste, so it will take 5 to 10 minutes for the paste to form. Once the paste has formed, add shallot and garlic and pound again to smash them into the paste, another 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add basil to the mortar and pound until it is fully incorporated into the paste.

For the Stir-Fry: In a wok, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable oil over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add roughly half of the kreung to the wok, stirring and scraping constantly with a wooden spatula to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. At first, the paste will snap and pop as it begins to release moisture. Continue stirring until all visible moisture has cooked off and the paste has thickened and darkened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.

Increase heat to high, then add half of the chicken to the wok, along with 1 piece of mudfish (if using) and cook, stirring, until chicken is coated in the kreung and has turned white on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes.

Stir in half of fish sauce, sugar, and bouillon and scrape browned bits from the bottom of the wok (some may still adhere). Stir in half the basil. Once basil has wilted, reduce heat to low and add half of jalapeño slices, cooking until warmed through but still crisp. Season with salt to taste.

Scrape contents of wok into a serving bowl and discard fermented fish. Rinse and dry wok, then repeat with remaining oil, kreung, chicken, and other ingredients.

Serve stir-fry right away, passing steamed white rice at the table.","Chicken Stir-Fry,Chicken Breast,Southeast Asian,Stovetop Chicken,Lemongrass",https://www.seriouseats.com/cambodian-chicken-stir-fry-recipe

1/4 cup (60ml) fish sauce, or as much as desired

Fried garlic, for garnish","Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Set whole tomatoes on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Roast until skins split and are browned in spots, about 25 minutes. When cool enough to handle, core and quarter tomatoes. Set aside.

Working directly over the flame of a gas burner, or on a rimmed baking sheet under the broiler (as close to the broiler element as possible), roast green peppers, turning often, until the skin of each is blistered and charred over about half its area. Transfer to a work surface, remove and discard stems, then chop flesh, skin, and seeds.

In a large 7-quart Dutch oven or pot, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add minced fresh garlic, red onion, chopped scallion whites, chopped peppers, and pork and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown on the bottom, about 10 minutes.

Thai Tea Cake with Condensed Milk Custard Sauce Recipe,Leela Punyaratabandhu,American,"2 cups whole milk, room temperature, divided

2 tablespoons unsweetened loose Thai tea leaves

8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened

1 1/2 cups (about 10 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar

3 large eggs, room temperature

2 1/4 cups (about 11 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 teaspoons baking powder

6 large egg yolks

1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk","Place 1 1/4 cups milk in a heat-proof bowl or glass measuring cup; microwave until warm, about 30 seconds. Add tea leaves and set aside.

Grease 10-inch springform pan or a 13- by 9- by 2-inch pan, and line it with a piece of parchment paper; set aside. Preheat oven to 350° F.

In a medium bowl stir together flour, salt, and baking powder; set aside. In a large mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, and continue to beat until the mixture is well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

Add eggs to the butter mixture, one at a time, beating after each addition, about 1 minute total.

Strain tea-infused milk through a fine mesh strainer. With a rubber spatula, alternately fold in flour mixture and tea-infused milk to butter mixture. Once the batter is well combined, spread it into the prepared pan, and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan.

Meanwhile, make the custard sauce by putting the remaining milk and condensed milk in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed pot or saucier over medium-low heat, whisking to combine. Place egg yolks in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.

Once the condensed milk mixture starts to boil, immediately remove the pot from heat. With one hand, slowly pour the hot milk into the yolks in thin stream. With the other hand, whisk the mixture vigorously making sure everything is well blended.

Pour the egg mixture back into the empty milk pot and put it on low heat, whisking constantly. In less than a minute, the custard sauce will thicken up. Take the pot off the heat, strain the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into a serving container, preferable one with a spout; keep covered and warm. (You should end up with approximately 2 1/2 cups of sauce.)

Serve the cake with the warm custard sauce. (If the sauce becomes too thick upon standing, thin it out with a little bit of warm milk.)","Cakes,Thai,Baking,Condensed Milk",https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-tea-cake-with-condensed-milk-custard-sauce-recipe

Shell shrimp and remove heads. Working in a large mortar and pestle, crush shrimp shells and heads until juices are extracted. Strain, reserving shrimp juices. Return shells and heads to the stock and simmer for 5 minutes longer. Keep shrimp chilled until ready to serve.

Strain stock, discarding solids. Reserve 1 quart (1 liter) stock for the sauce below, and freeze the rest for future use.

In a clean Dutch oven, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic and diced onion and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in annatto powder, followed by the crab paste, 1 quart (1 liter) reserved stock, and reserved shrimp juices. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.

Stir in the flaked fish, followed by the cornstarch slurry. Return to a simmer, then cook until sauce thickens. Add the remaining fish sauce in 1 tablespoon increments until it tastes well seasoned to you (you may not need all of it). Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Set sauce aside, stir in reserved chicken, then allow to cool slightly.

In a large pot of salted boiling water, add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil. Add noodles and cook, stirring gently to break them up, until softened and beginning to turn slightly clear, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in a sink, then run cold water all over the noodles to rinse and chill; toss noodles as you rinse them to ensure they're not stuck together. Set aside to drain fully.

Set a fine mesh strainer over a large heat-proof bowl or medium saucepan. Combine shallots and oil in a wok or medium saucepan. Place over high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots begin to bubble. Continue cooking, stirring constantly as the shallots fry to ensure even cooking. When shallots are light golden brown, transfer to strainer and drain. (Shallots will continue cooking for a brief period after draining, so do not allow them to get too dark). Immediately transfer to paper towel-lined tray and season with salt. Allow shallots to drain, then carefully lift the top layer of paper towels and roll shallots onto second layer, blotting gently with the first. Repeat, until shallots are on the last layer of paper towels and mostly grease-free. Set aside.

2 tablespoons canola oil

3/4 cup thinly sliced shallots

2 teaspoons minced garlic

4 Thai chiles, stemmed and minced

2 tablespoons rice wine

2 pounds ripe tomatoes (such as Roma or Early Girl), cored and diced

3/4 cups chicken stock

1 tablespoon fish sauce

Pork and Shrimp Wonton Filling

8 ounces shrimp, peeled, deveined, and finely chopped

4 ounces ground pork

1/3 cup fried shallots

3 tablespoons shallot oil

1 1/3 cups finely chopped fresh water chestnuts or jicama

1/3 cup black trumpet mushrooms

2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro

2 tablespoons finely chopped scallion, white and light green parts only

1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon oyster sauce

1 tabelspoon sesame seeds, toasted and ground to a coarse powder

1 tablespoon finely minced shallot

1 tablespoon fish sauce

2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil

Pinch ground black pepper

50 square wonton wrappers (1-pound package)

Cornstarch, for dusting

Canola oil, for deep-frying","To make the tomato sauce: In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until light golden brown. Add garlic and chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, 45 seconds more, until aromatic. Stir in the rice wine, tomatoes, and stock and bring to a boil. Decrease the heat so the mixture is at a gentle simmer and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes, to blend the flavors.

Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the fish sauce. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a blender and process until smooth. Keep warm. (The sauce can be made a day ahead, cooled, covered, and refrigerated; reheat before using.)

To make the wontons: In a bowl, combine the shrimp, pork, fried shallots, shallot oil, water chestnuts, mushrooms, cilantro, callion, oyster sauce, sesame seeds, raw shallot, fish sauce, sesame oil, and pepper and mix well. The mixture will be loose.

To form the wontons: Place a wonton wrapper on a work surface. Lightly brush the edges of the wrapper with water and place 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center. Top with a second wonton wrapper, pressing to enclose the filling and form a square, like a ravioli. Force out as much air as possible as you seal the edges to prevent the wontons from puffing up when you fry them. Transfer the finished wontons to a baking sheet or large tray lightly dusted with cornstarch. Repeat until you have used up all of the filling.

Pour the oil to a depth of 2 inches into a wok or high-sided pot and heat over high heat to 375°F on a deep-frying thermometer. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and place near the stove. Place a second rimmed baking sheet alongside. Preheat the oven to 200°F.

When the oil is ready, add one-third of wontons to the oil and fry for 3 minutes, until deep golden brown and crisp. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to the paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain briefly, then transfer to the second sheet pan and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with remaining wontons in two batches, always allowing the oil to return to temperature between batches.

Arrange the wontons on a platter and serve immediately, accompanied by the tomato sauce. Dip the wontons in the sauce and eat.","Hors D'Oeuvres,Vietnamese,Pork,Shrimp",https://www.seriouseats.com/charles-phans-hoi-an-wontons-with-spicy-tomat

1 tablespoon meaty dried shrimp

1/2 cup hot water

1 stalk lemongrass

1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened dried coconut flakes

1 shallot, about 1 ounce, peeled and sliced thinly against the grain

2 (1/4-inch-thick) slices galangal, coarsely chopped

2 tablespoons coarsely chopped peeled ginger

1 teaspoon shrimp paste

1/2 cup packed grated palm sugar plus 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar (or substitute 2/3 cup packed dark brown sugar)

1 tablespoon fish sauce

1/4 cup water

2 tablespoons finely chopped roasted peanuts

Salad

1 lime

1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice

2 shallots, about 1 ounce each, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice

1/2 cup roasted peanuts

5 or 6 fresh bird’s eye chilies, sliced crosswise 1/4 inch thick

1/3 cup meaty dried shrimp

To Serve

20 to 30 cha-phlu leaves or 3-inch squares collard green or Chinese broccoli leaves","To make the sauce, soak the dried shrimp in hot water for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, trim off and discard the leafy parts of the lemongrass stalk, remove the tough outer leaves of the bulb portion until the smooth, pale green core is exposed, and trim off the root end. Working from the root end, cut the bulb crosswise into paper-thin slices, stopping once you reach the point at which the purple rings disappear. Set the slices aside and discard the remainder.

Put the dried coconut flakes in a wok or 14-inch skillet and toast them on medium heat, stirring constantly, until medium brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the toasted coconut flakes for the sauce and set the remainder aside for the salad. Wipe out any toasted coconut sediment from the wok. Add the lemongrass slices, shallot, galangal, and ginger to the clean wok, then toast over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and the shallot slices are dry to the touch, about 5 minutes. Place the toasted mixture, drained dried shrimp, and shrimp paste in a mortar or a mini chopper and grind to a smooth paste.

Put the prepared paste, sugars, fish sauce, and water in a 1-quart saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. When the sauce has thickened and reduced to about 1 cup, after 2 to 3 minutes, take the saucepan off the heat. Let the sauce cool completely. Once the dressing is cooled, stir in the chopped peanuts and the reserved 2 tablespoons toasted coconut flakes and transfer to a small serving bowl.

To prepare the salad, quarter the lime lengthwise and trim away the core. Cut the quarters into 1⁄4-inch dice, leaving the rind intact. Alternatively, for those who are sensitive to the bitterness of the lime rind, cut the lime into wedges (as shown in the photograph) and invite diners to squeeze about 1/2 teaspoon lime juice onto each composed salad bite.

Arrange the lime, ginger, shallots, peanuts, chilies, dried shrimp, cha-phlu leaves, and the dressing on a large serving platter.

To eat, put a leaf on your palm, add a bit of each component to the center of the leaf, top with a small spoonful of dressing, gather up the corners of the leaf to form a bag, and eat the whole thing in one bite.

Note: If the diced ginger tastes too spicy hot, rinse it in cold water three or four times until the water runs clear and blot it dry.","Salads,Thai,Shrimp",https://www.seriouseats.com/leaf-wrapped-salad-bites-miang-kham-from-simple-thai-food

Crispy Fried Garlic and Garlic Oil Recipe,Sasha Marx,American,"2 heads garlic (about 5 ounces; 140g total), cloves separated, peeled, and trimmed

1 cup (240ml) vegetable oil

Kosher salt

Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)","Line a rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set a fine-mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl; set aside. Using a sharp knife, chop garlic into approximately 1/4- to 1/8-inch pieces. Alternatively, transfer whole garlic cloves to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until garlic is chopped into approximately 1/4- to 1/8-inch pieces, 10 to 12 pulses.

If cooking on stovetop: Combine chopped garlic and oil in a 2-quart saucepan or wok. Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until garlic begins to bubble steadily, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides and bottom of the saucepan to ensure even cooking and prevent garlic from sticking and scorching, until garlic turns pale golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Working quickly, pour contents of saucepan into prepared strainer set over bowl. (Garlic will continue cooking for a brief period after draining, so do not allow it to get too dark.)


If cooking in microwave: Combine garlic and oil in a large microwave-safe bowl and stir to break up any clumps. Microwave on high power for 5 minutes. Stir with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, scraping down sides of the bowl. Continue to microwave in 2-minute increments, stirring between each round, until garlic begins to turn lightly golden, 4 to 8 minutes total. Microwave in 30-second increments, stirring between each round, until evenly pale golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute and 30 seconds longer. Working quickly, pour contents of bowl into strainer set over bowl. (Garlic will continue cooking for a brief period after draining, so do not allow it to get too dark.)

Immediately transfer garlic to prepared baking sheet, spread out into an even layer, and season with salt. Using fine-mesh cocktail or tea strainer, lightly dust garlic with powdered sugar (if using). Allow garlic to drain, then carefully lift the top layer of paper towels and roll garlic onto second layer, blotting gently with the first. Allow fried garlic and garlic oil to cool to room temperature, then transfer to separate airtight containers, lining bottom of container for fried garlic with a folded paper towel.

Nem Chua (Vietnamese Cured Pork With Garlic and Chiles) Recipe,Jenny Dorsey,American,"2 pounds (900g) boneless pork loin or tenderloin (see note)

1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns (see note)

1 teaspoon whole white peppercorns

One 4-ounce (110g) package cooked pork skin, rinsed, drained, roughly chopped (see note)

7 medium cloves minced fresh garlic (25g), plus thinly sliced garlic cloves for garnish

4 red bird's eye chiles (5g), stemmed and minced, plus thinly sliced chili rounds for garnish

2 tablespoons sugar (30g)

1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond crystal kosher salt (for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight)

1 packet (70g) nam powder (including smaller packet of salts inside the main packet), such as Lobo","Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a sharp knife, trim pork loin of as much fat as possible; measure out 1.3 pounds (590g) trimmed meat and reserve any extra for another use (such as a stir fry or ground pork). Cut trimmed pork into roughly 2-inch chunks and arrange on a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze until very firm but not frozen solid, 15-20 minutes.

If Using a Meat Grinder: Place meat grinder parts in freezer to chill for 1-2 hours before processing. Using the second-smallest grinding die, grind pork into a clean work bowl. Switch to the finest die and grind pork once more into a medium-large mixing bowl.

If Using a Food Processor: Working in batches to avoid filling the processor more than halfway per batch, pulse processor until pork is finely ground, about 2 minutes. Transfer pork to a medium-large mixing bowl.

Using a spice grinder, grind black and white peppercorns to a fine powder. Add ground peppercorns to pork, along with prepared pork skin, minced garlic, minced chiles, sugar, and salt. Using a clean gloved hand or clean spatula, mix well.

Add curing packet (be sure to also add the contents of the smaller packet inside the main packet). Using a gloved hand, thoroughly mix all ingredients together by grabbing handfuls of the mixture, squishing it in your palm, and repeating until the entire mixture has taken on a sticky, paste-like consistency, about 5 minutes.

To Make Square-Shaped Nem Chua: Line an 8-inch square baking dish with plastic wrap. Add nem chua mixture to pan, and, using a spatula, smooth into an even layer. Set 1 slice of raw garlic and 1 chopped round of bird's eye chili into the surface approximately every 2 inches (you want these garnishes to top each square when you cut the nem chua). Cover nem chua with plastic wrap, pressing it firmly against the surface, and refrigerate at least 24 hours and up to 1 week before cutting and eating.

For Sausage-Shaped Nem Chua: Set a 12- by 12-inch square of plastic wrap on a work surface. Spoon 2 ounces (55g) nem chua mixture onto center of plastic wrap. Fold plastic wrap over nem chua mixture, then use your hands to form into a smooth log about 6 inches long and 1 1/4 inches thick.

Peel back plastic and add alternating slices of raw garlic and chiles along the entire length of the log. Carefully fold the plastic wrap back over the nem chua log, then roll once more to form an even cylinder shape. Make sure to squeeze gently as you do this, to remove as much air from the mixture as possible. Twist the ends of the plastic wrap in opposite directions to form a tightly wound cylinder of even thickness.

Repeat with remaining nem chua mixture, then refrigerate nem chua logs for at least 24 hours and up to 1 week before slicing into oblong rounds and eating.","Sausages,Vietnamese,No-Cook,Pork,Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/nem-chua-vietnamese-cured-pork
Goi Buoi (Vietnamese Pomelo Salad) Recipe,Tam Ngo,American,"For the scallops:

1 pound sea scallops, each roughly 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter (dry packed if available)

2 tablespoons peanut oil

Kosher salt

Freshly ground pepper

For the chilled ingredients:

1 large pomelo (about 3 pounds)

1 green mango, peeled and sliced into matchstick strips

1 large, fat carrot, peeled and sliced into matchstick strips

1 English cucumber, deseeded and sliced into matchstick strips

For the herbs:

1/2 cup Thai basil leaves, coarsely chopped

1/2 cup rau ram leaves, coarsely chopped

1/2 cup spearmint leaves, coarsely chopped

1/2 cup cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped

2 kaffir lime leaves, very thinly sliced (optional)

For the dressing:

1 red Thai bird chili, finely sliced

3 cloves garlic, pounded or pressed

2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice (about 1/2 lime)

1 tablespoon fish sauce

For the garnish:

4 tablespoons lightly toasted sesame seeds

1/2 teaspoon sea salt

4 tablespoons chopped Virginia-style roasted peanuts","Rinse scallops under cold water and thoroughly pat dry. Place scallops in a single layer on paper towels. Allow scallops to reach room temperature to draw out excess moisture. (See note.)

When ready to cook, sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper on their flat sides. Over a high flame, heat a non-stick pan with oil until it begins to smoke. Use tongs to add about 8-10 scallops to the pan, taking care that the scallops don't touch. (The scallops exude a little juice as they cook. When overcrowded in the pan, they steam rather than sear.) After 2 mintues, the contact side will develop a golden crust. Quickly flip the scallops and sear again for another 2 minutes. (The scallops should be lightly browned on each side but still translucent in the center.) Plate scallops immediately, and sear the next batch as necessary. Once all scallops have cooled, halve them lengthwise into thinner discs. Set aside.

Pomelo: With a paring knife, peel off the thick outer rind and cottony pith of the pomelo. Separate the fleshy pulp from the opaque skins that form each wedge. Gently pull chunks of pomelo pulp into bite-size pieces and place them into a gallon-sized Ziploc bag or large Tupperware.

Chilled ingredients: Prep mango, carrot, cucumber, and herbs. Gently toss these ingredients along with the scallops into the pomelo container. Refrigerate.

Dressing: Combine the chili, garlic, lime juice, and fish sauce in a small bowl. Refrigerate separately. An hour before serving, pour the dressing into the container holding the other refrigerated ingredients. Toss gently and fold through to combine.

Garnish: Heat a large flat skillet over medium heat. As it begins to smoke, add sesame and sea salt and toast for 2 to 4 minutes, tossing continuously to ensure even browning. The seeds will smell nutty and turn gold as they begin to brown. As soon as this happens, pour seeds onto a plate to cool. Plate the salad and garnish with toasted sesame and peanuts.

Note: Scallops sold in supermarkets are often pre-soaked in sodium tripolyphosphate (STP). STP plumps up scallops and increases the price per unit of weight. Unfortunately for the home cook, the excess moisture causes these pre-soaked scallops to steam rather than sear. Use dry-packed scallops if available and bring to room temperature to drain off fluids before cooking.","Salads,Vietnamese,Fruit,Scallops",https://www.seriouseats.com/goi-buoi-pomelo-salad-recipe

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons caramel sauce

3 pounds pork spareribs, cut crosswise through the bone into two long strips

1/2 large yellow onion, minced

1 tablespoon sugar

1 teaspoon black pepper

6 tablespoons fish sauce

6 tablespoons caramel sauce

2 scallions, green part only, chopped (optional)","Select a small, heavy saucepan, such as an enameled cast iron pan. Fill the sink with enough cold water to come halfway up the sides of the saucepan.

Put 1/4 cup of the water and all the sugar in the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. (If you are using a thinner pot, place over low heat to avoid scorching.) To ensure that the sugar melts evenly, stir with a metal spoon. After two minutes when the sugar is relatively smooth, stop stirring and let the mixture cook undisturbed. Small bubbles will form at the edges of the pan and grow larger, migrating towards the center. After approximately 7 minutes from when you started cooking, the bubbles will cover the entire surface and the mixture will be simmering vigorously. At this point, the liquid should be completely clear.

The color will turn from light yellow to a handsome auburn, and finally, to a darker brown. When the bubbles on the caramel become very orange, the caramel will turn the color of black coffee or molasses: at this point, immediately plunge the pot into the sink of cold water to stop the cooking. Rotate the pot around, checking the color and consistency of the syrup. (You may even want to remove the pot 10 seconds before the syrup turns the color of coffee, just to be safe.) Add the remaining 1/2 cup of water and wait for a few minutes. After the bubbling subsides, return the pan to the stove over medium heat.

Heat the caramel, stirring until it dissolves into the water. Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes before pouring into a small heatproof glass jar. Cool completely. The liquid should be slightly viscous, while the flavor will be bittersweet. Cover and store the sauce indefinitely in the cupboards. Makes about one cup.

Grilled Lemongrass Pork Spareribs

To make the marinade: combine the garlic, shallot, brown sugar, and pepper and a mortar and pestle and pound to a rough paste. Add the caramel sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, oil, and lemongrass, mixing well. In a large bowl, combine the marinade with the ribs and mix well to coat all of the meat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Remove the bowl from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Prepare a medium charcoal fire on your grill, or preheat a gas grill to medium. Alternatively, position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 475°F. Arrange the ribs on a baking sheet lined with foil.

Arrange the ribs on the grill rack, or slip the baking sheet into the oven. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until browned and a little charred on the edges. Monitor the progress, making sure the ribs cook evenly.

Serve the ribs immediately, garnishing with cucumbers or pickled vegetables if desired.

1 pound beef chuck, cut into rough 1-inch chunks, very cold

1 1/2 pounds chicken backs or wing tips, roughly chopped with a cleaver or cut with kitchen shears into 1-inch pieces, very cold

1 egg white

2 quarts low-sodium homemade or store-bought chicken broth

1 ounce (four packets) powdered gelatin

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1 (4-inch) hand ginger, split in half lengthwise

2 medium onions, split in half

2 tablespoons sugar

1/4 cup fish sauce, plus more to taste

3/4 pound flank steak, divided into two pieces

To Serve:

4 servings pho noodles, prepared according to package directions

2 cups mixed herbs (cilantro, basil, and mint)

2 cups trimmed bean sprouts

1/2 cup sliced scallions

Thinly sliced onions

Thinly sliced Thai chilis

2 limes, each cut into 4 wedges

Hoisin sauce and Sriracha","Place star anise, cinnamon, fennel, cloves, and coriander seeds in the center of a 6- by 6-inch double-layered square of cheesecloth. Tie into a pouch with butcher's twine. Set aside. Combine beef chuck, chicken, and egg white in a large bowl and toss to combine. Transfer 1/4 of mixture to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until a very rough puree is formed, about 15 one-second pulses. Transfer to another bowl. Repeat with remaining beef/chicken mixture until it is all processed. Set aside.

Place 2 cups chicken broth in a small bowl and sprinkle with gelatin. Set aside.

Heat oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over high heat until smoking. Add onions and ginger, cut side down. Cook without moving, reducing heat if smoking excessively, until onion and ginger are well charred, about 5 minutes. Flip over and cook until second side is charred in spots, about 5 minutes longer.

Add remaining 6 cups chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Add bundled aromatics, fish sauce, sugar, 1 pieces of flank steak, and chicken broth/gelatin mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Pour ground beef/chicken mixture into broth and whisk vigorously to break up. Allow broth to simmer, uncovered, until intensely flavored and aromatic, 30 to 45 minutes. Beef and chicken mixture should rise to surface and form a distinct layer. Do not break this layer up.

Using a slotted spoon or wire mesh spider, carefully remove ground beef mixture from surface of broth (it should form a relatively solid mass), along with onions, ginger, and spice packet and discard (or save any pieces of beef you'd like for the finished soup). Remove cooked flank steak, rinse thoroughly under cold running water, and transfer to a cutting board. Season broth to taste with more fish sauce, salt, and sugar. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean pot.

Thinly slice cooked flank steak and raw flank steak agains the grain with a sharp knife. To serve, place re-hydrated pho noodles in individual noodle bowls. Top with cooked flank steak (and any reserved chuck), and slices of raw flank steak. Pour hot broth over beef and noodles. Serve immediately, allowing guests to add herbs, aromatics, lime, and sauce as they wish.","Soups,Vietnamese,Beef,Quick Dinners",https://www.seriouseats.com/quick-and-easy-1-hour-pho
"Bánh Tráng Nướng (Grilled Vietnamese Rice Paper With Egg, Pork, and Condiments) Recipe",Jenny Dorsey,American,"For the Scallion Oil:

1 1/2 cups (275ml) neutral oil, such as peanut, vegetable, or canola

7 ounces (200g) scallions (about 2 or 3 bunches), roughly chopped

For the Sweet Chile Sauce:

3/4 cup (200ml) distilled white vinegar

1 cup (200g) sugar

8 medium cloves garlic (1 1/4 ounces; 35g), thinly sliced

15 bird's eye chiles (1 ounce; 30g), stemmed and thinly sliced

2 tablespoons (30ml) fish sauce

For the Lemongrass Pork Belly:

3 tablespoons (45ml) peanut or other neutral vegetable oil

1/2 medium red onion (3 1/2 ounces; 100g), thinly sliced

3 stalks lemongrass, bottom 4 to 5 inches only and outer leaves discarded (2 ounces; 55g), cut into 2-inch lengths

7 medium cloves garlic (1 ounce; 30g), smashed

One 1 1/2-inch knob peeled fresh ginger (1/2 ounce; 15g), thinly sliced

2 bird’s eye chiles, stemmed and halved lengthwise

1 1/4 pounds (565g) skinless pork belly, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

Kosher salt

3 tablespoons (45ml) fish sauce

1 teaspoon (4g) sugar

Freshly ground black pepper

To Cook and Assemble:

10-inch (25cm) rice paper wrappers, as needed

Scallion Oil, for topping

2 large eggs, beaten

Lemongrass Pork Belly, for topping

Sweet Chile Sauce, for topping

Pork, shrimp, or fish floss, for topping (see note)

Vietnamese coriander (rau răm) or cilantro leaves and tender stems, finely chopped, for topping","For the Scallion Oil: In a small saucepan, combine oil and scallions. Set over medium heat and cook until scallion begins to sizzle lightly, about 5 minutes.

Reduce heat to low and continue to cook until scallion greens have dulled, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes longer. Strain oil; discard scallions and reserve infused scallion oil for assembly.

For the Sweet Chili Sauce: In a small saucepan, combine vinegar, sugar, garlic, chiles, and fish sauce and bring to a boil over medium heat.

Reduce heat to low and let sauce simmer until chiles have dulled in color and cooked through, approximately 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool 5 minutes.

Using a blender or immersion blender, blend sauce until chiles and garlic are well processed (if using an immersion blender, transfer the sauce to a suitable, tall, narrow container first). Set aside.

For the Lemongrass Pork Belly: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, lemongrass, garlic, ginger, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until softened and golden, about 5 minutes.

Increase heat to high. Add pork belly, season lightly with salt, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until pork begins to brown and crisp in spots, about 3 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium, then stir in fish sauce and sugar and season with black pepper. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until pork belly is well browned, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, then discard onion, lemongrass, garlic, ginger, and chiles (some of the onion may have melted down and be difficult to remove, but that's fine). Set pork belly aside.

To Cook and Assemble: Set up your station: Set a metal wire rack directly over the gas burner of a stove (if cooking over the flame) or set a large nonstick skillet on burner. (If cooking directly over the burner, we recommend lining the stovetop around the burner with aluminum foil for easier cleanup in case of spills.) Arrange the toppings in squeeze bottles and/or small bowls with spoons.

Set a rice paper wrapper directly on the wire rack or in the skillet. Using a clean hand, generously wet the top side of the wrapper all over with water; hold it down securely, as it will want to curl up almost immediately. Press a second rice paper wrapper directly on top. Using a long-handled metal spoon, metal tongs, and/or a metal spatula, hold the rice paper wrappers down so they remain flush with the cooking surface and don't roll up (this can be tricky but with a little practice you'll get better at it).

Turn heat to medium high and cook, pressing down with the metal tools, rubbing in spots to help the rice paper wrappers fuse, and, if working directly over a gas burner, moving them around so they cook evenly all over, until rice paper wrappers have turned opaque and tiny bubbles have formed all over, about 30 seconds; lower or raise the heat as needed to cook them all over without burning.

Flip rice paper wrappers over and repeat on second side, lowering heat if needed to prevent burning. Turn off heat.

Drizzle about 2 teaspoons (10ml) scallion oil all over rice paper, then top with about 2 or 3 teaspoons beaten egg, making sure to brush it around for even coverage. Turn heat to medium and cook until egg is just beginning to set, about 30 seconds; if working directly over the burner, you may have to move the rice paper around to cook the egg in all spots.

Spoon an even layer of pork belly all over rice paper and cook just until pork is beginning to warm, about 15 seconds; adjust heat as needed to prevent scorching

Drizzle with chile sauce and top with pork floss and cilantro. Serve, using kitchen shears to cut the bánh tráng nướng into pieces.","Vietnamese,Pork,Rice & Grains,Lemongrass,Pork Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/banh-trang-nuong-grilled-vietnamese-rice-paper

1 1/2 tablespoon sea salt

Cold water

2 2/3 cup dried, hulled, and split yellow mung beans (soaked overnight and drained before assembly)

cold water

1 1/4 pounds boneless pork chop (or pork butt), with some skin and fat

1 medium-sized Vidalia or Spanish onion, minced

3 tablespoons of sea salt

3 teaspoons black pepper, freshly ground

1 tablespoon sugar

1 tablespoon canola oil or other neutral oil (if frying cakes)

Serve with Pickled Shallots:

10 ounces (about 2 cups) small shallots, unpeeled

boiling water

2 tablespoons salt, dissolved in 1 cup water

1/2 cup sugar

1 cup distilled white vinegar","For the Pickled Shallots: Put the shallots in a small heatproof bowl and cover them with boiling water. Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes, during which the skins will loosen and wrinkle. Pour off the hot water and add cold water to cool the shallots quickly. Drain shallots in a colander.

Return the peeled shallots to the bowl and pour in the salt solution. There should be enough for the shallots to float a bit. Let them stand overnight or up to 24 hours to remove some of their harshness.

Under cold running water, drain and rinse the shallots well. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and vinegar and bring to a rolling boil. Stir occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Add the shallots. When the liquid returns to a simmer, immediately remove the pan from heat. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shallots to a 1-pint jar. Pour in the hot vinegar solution and fill to the rim. Set aside to cool uncovered. Then, cover and refrigerate.

Allow the shallots to mature 5 days before serving. They will keep refrigerated for several weeks.

For Ready the Ingredients (The Night Before): Soak the bamboo leaves, placing them in a large roasting pan and adding water to cover. Put a plate on top of the leaves to keep them submerged.

Cut the pork into pieces the size of a deck of cards (3-inches long, 2-inches wide, and 1/2-inch thick). Each piece should have some fat and skin. Add the onion, fish sauce, pepper, and pork to a bowl and mix well. Let marinate overnight.

Place the mung beans in a bowl and rinse under cold water until the water is clear. Drain, then add enough cold water to cover beans by 1 inch. Let soak overnight.

For Ready the Ingredients (The Morning of Assembly): Drain the mung beans. Fill the Chinese steamer bottom halfway with water. (If the tray holes are larger than 3/16-inch in diameter, line the tray with parchment paper and leave a few holes uncovered for heat circulation.) Bring to a rolling boil.

Put mung beans in the steamer tray and spread them out evenly. Place the tray in the steamer of boiling water and cover. Steam for about 8 minutes, or until the mung beans are tender. Remove the tray from the steamer bottom and set aside until the beans cool.

Process the cooled beans in a food processor until it reaches a fluffy consistency. It should look like fine cornmeal but should hold together when you pinch a small bit between your fingers. At this point, the ground beans are ready.

Drain the rice in a colander and return it to the bowl. Gradually mix in the salt, sprinkling it over the rice and using your hands to distribute it well.

Drain the bamboo leaves, rinse, and set aside.

If you are using frozen banana leaves, defrost them by soaking them in hot water and rinsing thoroughly. Pat them dry and cut them into sheets of 5"" x 12"". Set aside.

To Assemble and Boil the Cakes: To make each cake, put a 12"" x 18"" inch sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil on your work surface, with the shortest side closest to you. Place the mold on the center of the foil. You will need 4 bamboo leaves to form the frame—the cor

Next, line the interior of the mold with banana leaves, shiny side up and facing you. (This allows the green of the banana leaves to dye the rice while cooking). Place a banana leaf so that one of its shortest sides lays flush with th

To add the edible ingredients, first scoop up 1 cup of the prepared rice and pour it into the mold. Use the back of a large spoon to distribute the rice evenly, taking care to push the rice all the way to the inner edges of the mold.

Repeat steps 10 through 13 for the remaining 3 cakes. (Save any leftover rice and steam it as you prefer.)

Fill a 12-quart stockpot half full with water. Place the cakes in the pot, stacking, and/or standing them up. Add enough water to cover the cakes. To keep the cakes from floating, place a heavy ceramic plate on top to gently weigh them. To maintain a gentle boil, keep a separate kettle of boiling water on the stove to replenish the stockpot as needed; it is okay if the water drops to an occasional simmer. When the cakes no longer float (about 3 hours into cooking), remove the ceramic plate.

After the seven hours, use tongs to transfer the cooked cakes to a pot of cold water. Once they are cool, transfer the cakes to a baking sheet, placing the seam-free, neater-looking, square side down. Put another baking sheet on top.

There are three ways to enjoy banh chung: soft, which allows you to fully appreciate the pale green color and subtle tea flavor of the banana leaf; fried into chewy crispiness; or grilled, which reduces the use of oil and creates a ge

Return the cake to the plastic wrap, open side up (as it was when you were assembling the cake). Peel off th Cut the cake into 8 equal triangular wedges (think of an asterisk). Because a knife drags through the sticky rice and yanks out the prized morsels within, twine is best for cutting through the cake. Cut 4 lengths of twine about 20-inches long and arrange.
To cut a cold cake and serve it soft: If the cake is firm from refrigeration, unwrap the plastic wrap and bamboo leaves. With a knife, cut an asterisk pattern through the banana leaves and cake. Microwave the pieces until soft and serve.
To fry and serve a cake: Nicely cut wedges are not necessary if you are frying the cake. Use a knife to quarter the cake, then cut each quarter into 1/2-inch thick slices. In a 10-inch non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add half of the slices and fry, undisturbed, for about 6 minutes (or until the rice has softened). Use a spatula to press and mash the chunks to form a large pancake. Flick the pancake with a quick and confident jerk of the skillet handle (or slide the pancake onto a plate and then invert the pancake back into the skillet). Increase the heat to medium-high and fry the second side for about 4 minutes (or until crispy). Slide the pancake onto a plate, cut into wedges, and serve. Repeat with the remaining slices to make a second pancake.
To grill a cake: Nicely cut wedges are not necessary if you are grilling the cake. Use a knife to quarter the cake, then cut each quarter into 1/2-inch thick slices. Lightly brush or spray the broader surfaces of the cake with enough oil to keep them from sticking to the grill. A charcoal grill or propane grill will give the cakes a light and even crust.

1 jalapeño pepper, seeds and stem removed, sliced into thin spears

1 bunch cilantro leaves and fine stems","Combine garlic, cilantro, sugar, white pepper, coriander, soy sauce, lemongrass, and half of oil in the bowl of a food processor. Process until a paste is formed, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as necessary. Brush or rub half of mixture over tofu slabs, stacking them in a plastic container or on a plate as you go.

To Cook on the Grill: Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place tofu over cooler side of grill at 45-degree angle to the grill grates. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Carefully rotate tofu 90 degrees and continue cooking until bottom side is crisp and has distinct hash marks, about 5 minutes longer. Carefully flip tofu and repeat cooking and rotating steps until crisp on both sides. Continue with step 4 and transfer tofu to a large plate to cool.

To Cook Under the Broiler: Oil a wire cooling rack and set it in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Arrange tofu slices on top in a single layer. Adjust rack to 6 to 8 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to low (if your oven has two broiler settings, otherwise just preheat the broiler). Broil tofu, turning and rotating every few minutes until crisp and browned on both sides, about 20 minutes total. Continue with step 4 and transfer tofu to a large plate to cool.

While tofu cooks, combine remaining marinade with remaining oil in a small bowl. When tofu is cooked, transfer to a large plate or cutting board and, using a brush or the back of a spoon, coat each piece with the remaining marinade. Cut each piece into slices slightly narrower than the baguettes.

Place baguettes on the cooler side of the grill (or place in oven and immediately shut off broiler if cooking indoors). Cover and cook until heated through and crisp, about 5 minutes. Split baguettes, leaving them hinged on one side. Spread with mayonnaise. Sprinkle bottoms and tops with liquid aminos, then spoon on a thin layer of the ginger-scallion oil if using. Layer with sliced tofu. Add pickled carrot/daikon mixture, cucumber spears, jalapeño, and cilantro. Season to taste with salt, close sandwiches, split in half crosswise (or if using full-sized standard baguettes, cut each into 3 to 4 serving pieces), and serve immediately.","Vietnamese,Vegan Mains,Vegetarian Mains,Fried Tofu,Tofu",https://www.seriouseats.com/grilled-lemongrass-coriander-marinated-tofu-vietnamese-sandwich-vegan-recipe
Phở Đuôi Bò (Vietnamese Noodle Soup with Oxtail) Recipe,Tam Ngo,American,"Spices:

10 star anise

10 whole cloves

5 inches of cassia bark or cinnamon stick

10 green cardamom pods

2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorn

2 teaspoons coriander seeds

2 slices of dried tangerine peel

Aromatics:

1 1/2 lb yellow onions, outer skin peeled

1 lb daikon, peeled and cut into 4-inch segments

1/2 lb carrots, peeled and halved

4 ounces ginger, peel-on and lightly smashed

Meat and Bones:

7 1/2 pounds oxtail, cut in cross-sections of roughly the same size and thickness

Broth Seasoning:

2 tablespoons sea salt

1/4 + 1/8 cup fish sauce

yellow rock sugar, to taste

Mise en Place:

1 1/2-2 pounds (1/4-inch wide) pho noodles, fresh or dried

1 medium sweet yellow onion, sliced paper-thin

scallions, cut into thin rings

cilantro, chopped

oxtail meat, brought to room temperature, removed from bones, and broken into chunks

Broth Seasoning:

pho broth (recipe above)

2-inch knob of ginger, lightly smashed and thickly sliced

fish sauce

yellow rock sugar

Tableside Garnishes:

spearmint (hung lui)

Thai basil (rau que)

thorny cilantro (ngo gai)

3/4 pound bean sprouts

3-4 red Thai bird chilis, deseeded and thinly sliced

2 limes, cut into wedges

fish sauce","Toast Spices: Toast the spices in a wide skillet over a low flame for approximately 2 minutes. Remove them from heat as they become fragrant. Cool before wrapping the spices in cheesecloth and tying off with twine.

Roast Aromatics: Balance ginger knobs on the cooking grate of a gas stove. On medium-low heat, use tongs or chopsticks to char the ginger against the open flame of the stove. After 4 minutes, they should soften and brown. Do the same for the onions. These aromatics are what sweeten the broth so don't worry too much about blackening the entire surface. Allow the aromatics to cool, then peel the skins, rinse, and set aside.

Parboil Meat and Bones: Place oxtail sections in the large stockpot and cover with cold water. Boil vigorously over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. (This frees the oxtail of marrow and other impurities that cloud the flavor of the soup.) Drain and rinse the oxtail. Scrub the stockpot of scum and return the oxtail to the cleaned pot.

Prepare Broth with Oxtail:

In the oxtail stockpot, add 7 1/2 quarts of cold water along with the spice sachet, onions, ginger, daikon, carrots, sea salt, and fish sauce. Over high heat, bring the ingredients to a boil.

Reduce the flame, and keep the broth bubbling lightly at the lowest possible simmer. Simmer for 7 to 8 hours until the meat is deeply aromatic and shrugs off the bone in hunks.

Remove the oxtail and submerge them in a clean pot of cold water for approximately 10 minutes. (This prevents the meat from drying out as it cools.) Drain the sections and bring them to room temperature. Then, secure them in plastic and refrigerate.

Discard all remaining solids, aromatics, and the spice sachet. Use a chinois or a fine strainer double-lined with cheesecloth to strain the broth into a second, clean stockpot. Cool the pot of broth in a sink of cold water, then store in the refrigerator overnight to allow the flavors to develop. The fat will separate to the top and the gelatin-rich broth will congeal.

Day 2: Bowl Assembly To ensure the spring of the noodles don't get sodden in the broth, arrange the dry ingredients (noodles, onions, and oxtail meat) in bowls and seat guests before ladling on the liquid. Guests will enjoy plunging through the heady steam as the soup is slurped.

Tableside Garnishes: Rinse, drain, spin (or pat) dry the final garnishes before arranging on a plate.

Mise en Place: If using dry pho noodles, submerge the noodles in hot water for 20 minutes until softened; drain. (If using fresh noodles, simply rinse the noodles under cold water and drain.)

In a clean stockpot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Place the noodles in a long-handled strainer and blanch just until the noodles lose their stiffness. (Depending on the noodle and its thickness, this can take anywhere between 10 seconds to 2 minutes.) Drain.

Fill each serving bowl a quarter of the way up with noodles. Top with oxtail meat, onions, scallions, and cilantro.

Broth Seasoning: Remove the stockpot of broth from the refrigerator. Scoop off the white crust of fat but reserve some for flavor. Place the pot of gelatinous broth on heat. The broth will liquefy as it's brought to a rolling boil.

Refresh the flavor of the broth by adding ginger slices. Adjust the flavor of the broth with fish sauce and yellow rock sugar. (If the broth tastes a little strong, don't worry. The noodles and herbal garnishes will temper the flavor.)

Serving Guests: Ladle the broth into each prepared bowl and fully submerge the noodles. (The proportion of broth to noodles should be roughly 3:1.) Serve immediately. Invite guests to hand-shred tableside garnishes into their bowls and to add lime, fish sauce, and/or chili pepper to taste.","Soups,Vietnamese,Stovetop Noodles,Oxtail,Noodles",https://www.seriouseats.com/pho-duoi-bo-vietnamese-noodle-soup-with-oxtail-recipe

Thai-Style Grilled Pork Skewers (Moo Ping) Recipe,Sasha Marx,American,"4 medium garlic cloves (20g), minced

2 tablespoons (15g) minced cilantro stems, plus fresh cilantro leaves for serving

2 tablespoons (30g) finely chopped palm sugar (see note)

1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce

1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce

1 tablespoon (15ml) oyster sauce

1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) ground white pepper

1/2 teaspoon (2g) MSG powder (optional)

2 pounds (900g) pork butt, in one piece

1 (5 1/2-ounce; 160ml) can unsweetened coconut cream

1 recipe Thai Dried Chili-Vinegar Dipping Sauce, for serving (optional)","In a small bowl, combine garlic, cilantro stems, palm sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper, and MSG (if using), and stir until palm sugar is dissolved. Set aside.

Freeze pork for 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes (partially freezing the pork makes it easier to slice). Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice pork against the grain into 2-inch-long, 1-inch-wide, and 1/8-inch-thick strips. The easiest and most efficient way to do this is to start by portioning the pork butt into 2-inch-wide by 1-inch-thick pieces, and then slicing those pieces crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick strips.

Combine pork and marinade in a large bowl, and, using hands, toss until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to 36 hours.

Thread one piece of pork onto a skewer, piercing it through twice to secure it, then bunching meat tightly together like an accordion. Continue threading pork onto skewer, making sure meat is tightly bunched together, leaving no parts of the skewer exposed except for a 2-inch handle at the bottom, and the pointy tip at the top. Repeat skewering process with remaining pork.

Set up grill for skewers, making sure to adjust distance between bricks to the length of your skewers. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly in the channel between the bricks.

Place skewers directly over the hot coals, balancing them on top of the bricks, with the handles overhanging the bricks closest to you and the tips balancing on the farther wall of bricks. Using a brush, brush pork with coconut cream. Cook, turning skewers and brushing pork with coconut cream frequently, until meat is lightly charred, and a piece of pork looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, 8 to 10 minutes; if flare-ups occur, move the skewers around as needed to get them away from the flames. Transfer to serving platter and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately, passing lime wedges, as well as cilantro and dipping sauce (if using), at the table.","Thai,Grilled Pork,Pork Shoulder,Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-style-grilled-pork-skewers-moo-ping

For the Fried Eggs:

2 large eggs

5 tablespoons (75ml) vegetable oil (see note)

Cooked jasmine rice","For the Dressing and Fresh Aromatics: In a small mixing bowl, stir together lime juice, fish sauce, and palm sugar until palm sugar is fully dissolved, about 15 seconds.

Add shallot, garlic, lemongrass, Thai chiles, cilantro sprigs, and scallion to dressing. Gently stir to combine and evenly coat solids with dressing. Set aside.

For the Fried Eggs: Line a plate or small tray with paper towels. Crack eggs into a small, shallow bowl. In a wok or 8-inch carbon steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Holding the bowl closely above the oil, carefully slip the eggs into the oil in one swift and smooth motion to prevent oil from splattering; the egg whites should immediately puff and bubble around the edges. Cook undisturbed for 20 seconds, then begin swirling the pan to prevent eggs from sticking. Continue to cook, swirling pan constantly to promote even cooking of the whites, until the inner part of the whites close to the yolks are fully set, and the edges are wispy, golden brown, and crisp, about 1 minute. Using a large spoon or wok spatula, baste the yolks 2 to 4 times with hot oil until they just turn opaque and look like yolks on American-style, over-easy fried eggs. Using a slotted or wok spatula, carefully lift eggs out of oil, draining off as much excess oil as possible, and transfer to prepared paper towel–lined plate.

For Serving: Gently transfer fried eggs to a serving plate. Spoon the aromatics, herbs and dressing over the eggs, and garnish with cilantro leaves.

Beef Short Rib Rendang Recipe,Chichi Wang,American,"15-pound short rib, bone-in cut 1 1/2 inches long

Turmeric Paste:

0.6 ounces dried chili- soaked in warm water

0.8 ounces Thai chili, sliced no stems

1.1 ounces galangal, sliced

2.4 ounces young ginger, sliced

1 ounces tumeric root, sliced

12 ounces lemongrass, cleaned and sliced

Shallot Paste:

7 ounces shallots, peeled and rough chopped

7 ounces garlic, peeled and rough chopped

3 ounces palm sugar, chopped

Braise:

5 cups coconut milk

6 slices of assam skin (see note)—washed

1/4 cup kosher salt

13 ounces of kerisik

Gula Jawa Syrup:

1/4 cup Gula Jawa (a type of palm sugar)

1/4 cup water

Garnish:

10 Kaffir lime leaves, very thinly slices lengthwise

3 limes, cut into wedges

Coconut Rice:

1 quart Jasmine rice, washed and drained

1 quart water

1 tablespoon salt

1 pandan leaf (1.5 ounces), tied in knot

3 tablespoons sugar

1 can (1 3/4 cup) coconut milk, at 70°F","Two days before cooking:


Tumeric paste: Combine first set of ingredients and pound in a mortar or purée in food processor. Use some of the chili soaking water to help the machine purée the ingredients, if necessary. The purée should be as smooth as you can possibly get it, but don't stress out if there are some chunky bits; it'll be fine. In a container large enough to hold all the beef, rub the paste all over the beef and leave it in the container sitting in the fridge to marinate for 48 hours. Wear gloves when working with turmeric and turmeric paste as it will stain your hands.

The day of cooking:


Shallot Paste: Purée all the ingredients in a food processor until as smooth as possible. Scoop the paste out into a small container and let it hang out until you are ready to use it.


To braise: Preheat the oven to 225°F.


Place marinated short ribs in a single layer in a deep-sided roasting pan. You may need 2 pans to avoid stacking. Season each pan with the 1/8 cup kosher salt, or, if it all fits in one big pan, use 1/4 cup of kosher salt to season the whole deal. Divide the coconut milk, shallot paste, and assam skins evenly and add to the roasting pans. Toss the ribs to incorporate all the ingredients. Cover the pan(s) with parchment and top with tight fitting lid of foil.


Braise at 225°F until fork tender, about 6 to 6 1/2 hours.

Prepare the Gula Jawa Syrup anytime, as it keeps for months.


For Gula Jawa Syrup: Add gula jawa and water to sauce pot. Simmer on low flame until sugar has completely dissolved. Reserve warm for serving. To store, place in airtight container in refrigerator.


You can prepare the kerisik well in advance too.

To serve your rendang: Remove the ribs from the oven and carefully remove the foil and parchment and to make sure they are tender. If not, put the ribs back in the oven and continue cooking. If so, sprinkle the toasted coconut flakes over the ribs. The kerisik will absorb some of the fat and adhere to the meat thus increasing the unctuous, splendiferous flavor.


Spoon as many ribs as you would like to serve for this occasion into a large serving bowl or platter. Top with the braising liquid, oil and all. If you are keeping some ribs in reserve, reserve some of the liquid too. Drizzle the gula jawa syrup over the meat and sprinkle the thin sliced kaffir lime leaves on top. Serve the ribs with a side bowl of cut lime wedges and a large bowl of steamed coconut rice.

To make the coconut rice: In a large bowl or large sieve with holes small enough to prevent the rice from falling through, wash rice thoroughly under cold running water until the water runs clear. Dump the rice in a rice cooker and add salt, sugar, pandan leaf, and 1 quart of water. Cook until the cooker clicks, proclaiming the rice as finished. Fluff for a moment and pour in coconut milk. Mix the coconut milk and cooked rice gently and thoroughly. Season with salt to taste and keep warm in the rice cooker until dinner. If dinner is waiting on the rice, dump it into a bowl.

Onde-Onde Recipe,Chichi Wang,American,"For the filling

2 ounces palm sugar

&nbsp

For the dough

1 small sweet potato (about 1/2 pound)

1 1/4 cups sweet glutinous rice flour

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

3 tablespoons water, if needed to moisten the dough

&nbsp

For serving

1 cup freshly grated coconut, plain or toasted","Roll or cut the sugar into 1/4 inch pieces. Pack them into pea-sized chunks by pressing or rubbing them between damp fingers. Don't worry if the chunks seem flaky or powdery—the sugar will settle and stay clumped when fashioning the rice balls. Make about 40 pieces.

Place the sweet potato in a small saucepan, pour in enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 20 minutes until the potato is fork tender. Drain. Once it's cool enough to hand, peel off the skin and press the flesh through a potato ricer into a small bowl.

Combine the rice flour with the sweet potato and knead with your hands until well mixed. The dough should be very soft and moist, but not sticky. Add additional water or flour until you get a texture that will hold together when rolled into balls.

Pinch off a small piece of the dough and roll it into a ball about 3/4 inches in diameter. With your index or pinky finger, make a hole in the ball and place the chunk of palm sugar inside, pinching the dough closed to seal the hole. Use water if necessary to make the edges stick together. Place onto a tray dusted with a bit of rice flour, and repeat with the remaining dough.

Have a plate with the grated coconut ready. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep at a steady simmer. Add the dumplings to the water and stir gently. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the surface looks semi-opaque.

Remove the balls from the water with a slotted spoon. Roll the balls around in the grated coconut. Serve at room temperature. The balls will keep, unrefrigerated, for two days.","Desserts,Malaysian,Sweet Potatoes",https://www.seriouseats.com/onde-onde-recipe

1/4 cup Sambal Belacan (Nyonya Sambal)

10 candlenuts

8 ounces firm (cotton) tofu, cut into 2 inch cubes or triangles

1 cup coconut milk

3 cups water

1 tablespoon sugar

1 teaspoon salt

Choice of vegetables

Kale

Cabbage

Green beans

Potatoes

Carrots","1.  To make the paste, combine the sambal belacan with the rest of the spices (the coriander, cumin, fennel, peppercorns, and turmeric). If you are using whole seeds, ground the seeds beforehand in a mortar and pestle before adding them to the sambal. Add enough water so that the paste is the consistency of a very thick cream soup.

2.  Place a soup pot or a heavy saucepan over low heat. Over medium heat, heat two tablespoons of oil. Place the paste into the oil and saute. Lower the heat to low, stirring occasionally. The paste should sizzle slightly but not cook too quickly. Continue to saute for 5 minutes, until the oil begins separates from the paste.

3.  Add the lemongrass and the chicken and stir well to combine. Raise the heat to medium and saute, stirring often, until the chicken is slightly browned on all sides.

4.  Add the water, coconut milk, cinnamon stick, star anise, sugar, and salt and stir well to combine. Raise the heat and bring the soup to a simmer. Reduce the heat and cook for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is tender. Add the fried tofu and continue to simmer for a few more minutes.

To assemble the dish: Divide the bean spouts among 4 large soup bowls, covering the entire bottom of the bowls with a layer of spouts. Evenly mound the egg noodles on top of the bean sprouts. Ladle the kare laksa into the bowls. Eat immediately, with lime juice squeezed over the top. If desired, serve the Javanese sambal on the side for eaters to spoon into their broths.

Simmered Tofu and Vegetables

- makes enough for four to six servings as a side dish -

1.  To deep-fry the tofu: dry the cut pieces of raw tofu with paper towels. Pour oil to a depth of 1 inch in a wok and place over high heat until the oil is hot but not smoking (around 350°F.) Add the tofu pieces. The oil will begin to bubble vigorously around the tofu. Using chopsticks or a slotted spoon, flip the tofu around so that the all the pieces are golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer the fried tofu to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.

2. Using a mortar and pestle, grind the candlenuts into a paste. Add the nuts to the sambal and mix thoroughly.

3.  Place a soup pot or a heavy saucepan over low heat. Over medium heat, heat two tablespoons of oil. Place the candlenuts and sambal paste into the oil and saute. Lower the heat to low, stirring occasionally. The paste should sizzle slightly but not cook too quickly. Continue to saute for 5 minutes, until the oil begins separates from the paste.

Add the water and coconut milk, sugar, and salt and stir well to combine. Raise the heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Add the chopped vegetables and reduce the heat. Simmer the mixture until the vegetables are tender—this will vary according to whatever vegetables you choose. You may need to stagger the order the vegetables are added to the liquid: cubed potatoes will only take 10 to 15 minutes to cook, whereas kale will take at least 30 minutes. Fifteen minutes prior to when the last kind of vegetable will be cooked through, add the fried tofu and continue to simmer.

Scatter with herbs and place beef directly on the salt on the edge closest to you.

Carefully roll the beef up until it is completely surrounded in salt. Tuck the leading side of the towel into the roll, fold in the sides to form a neat package, then continue rolling until the beef is completely wrapped in the towel.

Using butcher's twine, secure the package at 1- to 2-inch intervals, tying as tightly as possible.

Perfect Refried Beans (Frijoles Refritos) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,Mexican,"1/2 pound dried pinto or black beans

Water

2 sprigs fresh epazote or oregano (see note)

1 medium white onion, 1/2 minced (about 1/2 cup), 1/2 left whole

2 medium cloves garlic

Kosher salt

6 tablespoons lard, bacon drippings, vegetable oil, or butter (see note)","In a large pot, cover the beans with cold water by at least 2 inches. Add herb sprigs, the whole onion half, and garlic cloves and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to simmer and cook until beans are very tender, about 1 to 2 hours. Season with salt.

5 ears fresh corn, husks and silks removed

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 red onion, chopped

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

½ teaspoon salt

Black pepper

2 cups Monterey Jack cheese, or other Mexican melting cheese

½ cup Mexican crema","Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 375°.

Meanwhile, if you have a gas stove, turn heat to high on one of the burners, and set as many of the poblanos as will fit on the grate. Cook, flipping and moving the chiles often with a pair of tongs, until blackened on all sides. If you don't have a gas stove, turn on broiler to high. Place chiles on a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil, and place underneath the broiler. Cook, flipping occasionally with a pair of tongs, until blacked on all sides.

When chiles are blackened, transfer to a plastic bag and seal. Let them steam for at least five minutes. When done, peel off the blackened skins. Cut a slit down the side of each, starting under the stem and continuing down to the tip. Carefully remove the seeds, being careful not to tear the chile.

34 ounces (4 cups; 965g) fresh goat's milk, preferably UHT (see note)

6 ounces (3/4 cup; 170g) sugar

1/2 + 1/8 teaspoon baking soda

1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt","Split the vanilla bean with a paring knife and scrape out seeds with the flat of the blade; reserve seeds for another use. Combine split vanilla pod with goat’s milk, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a 5-quart stainless steel pot. Warm over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat-resistant spatula, until sugar dissolves and milk turns foamy and light, about 15 minutes.

Continue cooking at a gentle simmer, stirring and scraping the sides of the pot frequently if not constantly, until milk is thick, golden, and reduced to no more than a thin, super-jammy layer, about 45 minutes; stir more frequently as the cajeta thickens to prevent scorching. Continue cooking until cajeta forms a ""trail"" that remains open for 1 second when a spatula is scraped across the bottom of the pot. Remove from heat. Using tongs, remove and discard vanilla pod. Scrape cajeta into a heat-resistant, wide-mouth glass jar. If the total amount is less than 12 1/2 ounces (1 cup; 355g), thin with a touch of milk or water or else the cajeta will be too thick on cooling.

Homemade Tacos Al Pastor Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Mexican,"For the Pork:

2 whole ancho chilies, seeds and stems removed

2 whole pasilla or guajillo chilies, seeds and stems removed

1/2 cup homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock

2 teaspoons vegetable oil

1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano

1 teaspoon dried ground cumin seed

1 tablespoon achiote powder or paste

1 chipotle chili packed in adobo sauce, plus 2 teaspoons sauce from can

1/4 cup distilled white vinegar

3 whole cloves garlic

2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

2 teaspoons sugar

2 pounds boneless blade-end loin or sirloin pork roast

8 ounces (1/2 pound) sliced bacon

To Finish and Serve:

1 small pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into quarters lengthwise

32 to 48 corn tortillas, heated and kept warm

1 medium white onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)

1/2 cup finely minced fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems

1 cup basic salsa verde or your favorite salsa

3 to 4 limes, cut into 8 wedges each for serving","Place chilies in a large saucepan over medium high heat and cook, turning chilies occasionally, until puffed, pliable, lightly browned in spots, and very aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock (it should boil immediately), then pour contents of pan into a small bowl. Cover loosely and set aside.

Wipe out saucepan, add oil, and return to medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Add cumin, oregano, and achiote and cook, stirring frequently, untila aromatic but not browned, about 30 seconds. Add chipotle chilies and sauce and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds longer. Add vinegar, salt, and sugar and remove from heat.

Scrape contents of saucepan into a blender along with garlic and chilies with their soaking liquid. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as necessary. Set sauce aside to cool slightly.

Using a very sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice the meat as thin as possible. If necessary, place meat in freezer for 15 minutes to firm it up. Split the sides of a heavy duty zipper-lock bag. Place one slice of meat inside bag and pound with the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet or a meat pounder until less than 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining meat.

Add marinade to bowl and toss with hands until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade.

Line the bottom of a disposable aluminum loaf pan with bacon. Add a layer of thin-sliced marinated meat. Continue layering in bacon and meat until all the meat is used up. (It may pile above the pan a little bit. This is ok.) Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36.

To cook indoors: preheat the oven to 275°F. Uncover aluminum loaf pan and place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven and cook until meat is completely tender (It will drip lots of fat), about 4 hours. Remove from oven, allow to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

To cook outdoors: light half a chimney of charcoal and allow to preheat until coals are mostly covered in gray ash. Spread out under one half of coal grate, and place cooking grate on top. Alternatively, set one set of burners on a gas grill to low and leave the remaining burners off. Unwrap aluminum loaf pan and place directly over cooler side of grill, placing a drip pan underneath if desired. Cover grill and cook until loaf registers 180 to 190°F in the center, about 4 hours, adding more coals to grill or adjusting burners as necessary to maintain an air temperature of around 275°F for the duration of cooking. Remove from grill, allow to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

To Serve: Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove cooked meat from aluminum tray, scraping off any fat or jellied juices from its sides. Use a spoon to collect fat and juices from tray, reserving each separately. Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice meat as thinly as possible to create fine shavings of meat and fat. Transfer to a bowl.

If fat from meat is solid, heat gently in the microwave or in the oven until melted. Transfer pineapple pieces to a rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Brush with fat. Transfer to oven and roast until completely tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.

About 10 minutes before pineapple is done roasting, transfer meat and 1 tablespoon of fat to a large cast iron or non-stick skillet. Heat over medium high heat, stirring occasionally, until meat crisps and deeply browns in spots. Add any reserved juices and toss to combine, allowing it to cook until reduced to a moist glaze. Transfer meat to a warmed serving bowl.

Chop roasted pineapple into large chunks. Serve meat and pineapple immediately with warmed tortillas, onions, cilantro, salsa, and lime wedges. Meat will be very moist and should be packed into double-stacked tortillas for serving.","Cinco de Mayo,Mexican,Grilled Pork,Roasted Pork,Pineapple",https://www.seriouseats.com/tacos-al-pastor-recipe

Once again, cook the sugar until it caramelizes and reaches your preferred shade of golden. Add the cream and milk and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the caramel.

Tempering With a Blender: Pour the caramel, cream, and milk mixture into the pitcher of a blender. Turn blender on to low and, while the blender is running, add whole eggs, yolk, salt, and vanilla.


Tempering Eggs With a Whisk: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, yolks, salt, and vanilla. Slowly whisk the hot cream mixture into the eggs one ladleful at a time until it is all fully incorporated. Pour into the prepared caramel-lined dish and cover lightly with plastic wrap or foil.

Baking the Custard: Prepare a roasting dish, casserole dish, or another oven-safe pan large enough to accommodate the dish holding the custard by placing a ring of foil or a wire rack inside it to act as a booster seat. Rest custard dish on top and place in oven. Once in the oven, pour boiling water into the roasting dish until about halfway up the side of the custard dish. Bake until the custard is just set to the touch, with a slight jiggle in the center and an instant read thermometer reads 175°F (80°C) in the center, about 45 minutes. Cool fully in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. When ready to serve, run a paring knife or offset spatula along the edge to loosen the flan from the dish and flip over onto a rimmed plate to catch the caramel sauce. Sprinkle with Maldon salt to taste. Keeps in the fridge covered for 3 to 5 days.","Custards, Mousses & Puddings,Mexican,Cinco de Mayo,Easter,Mother's Day",https://www.seriouseats.com/double-caramel-flan-recipe
Pozole Verde de Pollo (Green Mexican Hominy and Chicken Soup) Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Mexican,"For the Soup:

3 ounces pumpkin seeds (85g; about 1/2 cup)

2 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken leg quarters (1.2kg; about 3 leg quarters)

1 pound tomatillos (450g)

1 large white onion, roughly chopped

1 jalapeño pepper, stems and seeds removed, roughly chopped

1 poblano pepper, stems and seeds removed, roughly chopped

1 Anaheim pepper, stems and seeds removed, roughly chopped

6 cups homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock (1.5 liters)

2 tablespoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican (about 8g)

2 sprigs epazote (optional)

Salt

Handful fresh cilantro leaves and fine stems

1 (28-ounce; 800g) can white hominy, drained (see note)

To Serve:

Diced avocado

Diced radishes

Thinly sliced serrano or jalapeño peppers

Chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Finely chopped white onion","For the Soup: Heat pumpkin seeds in the base of a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until they start to pop and smell nutty, about 4 minutes. Transfer pumpkin seeds to a bowl and set aside.

Add chicken, tomatillos, onion, peppers, chicken stock, oregano, epazote (if using), and a large pinch of salt to the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a bare simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken and vegetables are completely tender, about 40 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer chicken to a large plate or bowl and set aside. Discard epazote sprigs (if using). Set a large fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the broth through it. Transfer solids to the jar of a blender. Add pumpkin seeds and cilantro to the blender. Blend on high speed until smooth. Set aside.

Using a ladle, carefully skim off a few tablespoons of fat from the strained stock and add it to the Dutch oven (it's okay if a little stock gets in as well). Heat over high heat, swirling and stirring until the watery stock completely evaporates and starts to form a browned layer in the bottom of the pan. (It will spatter a bit. The more you stir, the less it will spatter.) As soon as the chicken fat starts to smoke, pour in the contents of the blender all at once and cook, stirring, for about 15 seconds (it will spatter a lot—wear an apron!). Immediately pour in strained chicken stock and fat and stir to combine. Bring to a bare simmer, stir in hominy, season to taste with salt, and keep warm.

By this stage, the chicken should be cool enough to handle. Discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces with your fingertips. Stir the picked chicken back into the soup.

To Serve: Ladle the hot soup into bowls and garnish with diced avocado and radish, sliced chilies, chopped cilantro, and chopped white onion. Serve immediately.","Mexican,Braised & Stewed Chicken,Chicken Legs,Pumpkin Seeds,Hominy",https://www.seriouseats.com/pozole-verde-de-pollo-green-mexican-hominy-and-chicken-soup-recipe

"Tacos Árabes (Pita-Wrapped, Cumin-Marinated-Pork Tacos) Recipe",Daniel Gritzer,Mexican,"For the Pork:

2 pounds (about 1kg) boneless blade-end loin or sirloin pork roast

1/2 small yellow onion, thinly sliced

2 tablespoons (30ml) fresh juice from 1 lime

1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) ground cumin

1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) ground dried oregano (preferably Mexican)

2 teaspoons (8g) kosher salt

8 ounces sliced bacon (1/2 pound; 225g)

For the Chipotle Salsa:

1 (7-ounce; 200g) can chipotle chilies in adobo sauce

1 medium clove garlic

2 teaspoons (10ml) distilled white vinegar

1 teaspoon (4g) ground dried oregano (preferably Mexican)

1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) ground cumin

Water, as needed

Kosher salt

For the Yogurt Sauce:

1 cup (240ml) full-fat yogurt

1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh juice from 1 lemon or lime

1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons (6g) minced flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems

2 medium cloves garlic, minced

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

For Serving:

8 rounds pita bread, warmed (see note)

Lime wedges","For the Pork: Using a very sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice pork as thinly as possible. If necessary, place meat in the freezer for 15 minutes to firm it up. Split the sides of a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag. Place one slice of meat inside bag and pound with the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet or a meat pounder until less than 1/4 inch thick. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining meat.

Add onion, lime juice, cumin, oregano, and salt to pork and toss with hands until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade.

Line the bottom of a disposable aluminum loaf pan with bacon. Add a layer of thin-sliced marinated pork. Continue with alternating layers of marinated pork and bacon until all the meat is used up. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36.

To Cook Indoors: Preheat oven to 275°F. Uncover aluminum loaf pan and place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven and cook until meat is completely tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 180°F, 2 to 3 hours (it will render lots of fat). Remove from oven, allow to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

To Cook Outdoors: Light half a chimney of charcoal and allow to preheat until coals are mostly covered in gray ash. Spread out under one half of coal grate and place cooking grate on top. Alternatively, set one set of burners on a gas grill to low and leave the remaining burners off. Unwrap aluminum loaf pan and place directly over cooler side of grill, placing a drip pan underneath if desired. Cover grill and cook until loaf registers 180°F in the center, about 3 hours, adding more coals to grill or adjusting burners as necessary to maintain an air temperature of around 275°F for the duration of cooking. Remove from grill, allow to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

For the Chipotle Salsa: In a blender, combine chipotles and their sauce, garlic, vinegar, oregano, and cumin. Add 1 cup water and blend at high speed until a smooth purée forms; add more water as necessary, 1 tablespoon at a time, to reach a thick yet pourable consistency. Season with salt. Chipotle salsa can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.

For the Yogurt Sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon or lime juice, olive oil, parsley, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Yogurt sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.

To Serve: Remove cooked meat from aluminum loaf pan, scraping off any fat or jellied juices from its sides; reserve rendered fat and juices. Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice meat as thinly as possible to create fine shavings of meat and fat.

Transfer meat and 1 tablespoon of fat to a large cast iron or nonstick skillet. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until meat crisps and browns in spots. Add any reserved juices and toss to combine, allowing juices to cook until reduced to a moist glaze. Transfer meat to a warmed serving bowl.

Serve warmed meat right away with warmed pita bread, lime wedges, chipotle salsa, and yogurt sauce.","Tacos,Mexican,Grilled Pork,Pork,Cinco de Mayo",https://www.seriouseats.com/tacos-arabes-pita-cumin-mexican-pork-recipe

3 dozen dried corn husks, soaked in water for at least 1 hour

Salsa verde, for serving","Roast peppers directly over the flame of a gas stove, grill, or under a hot broiler, turning occasionally, until skin is completely charred and blackened all over. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand until cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes. Using paper towels, rub off charred skin, then stem and seed poblanos. Slice peppers into strips 1/4 inch thick and 2 to 3 inches long.

Easy Nixtamalized Corn Tortillas Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,Mexican,"200g (7 ounces) dried white, yellow, or blue dent or field corn (see note)

600ml (2 1/2 cups) water, plus more as needed

3g pickling lime (or other food-grade slaked lime) (see note)

Masa harina para tortillas, as needed","In a medium pot, combine corn and water; pick out any stones that may be hiding among the corn kernels. Add pickling lime and set over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, adjusting heat to maintain simmer. Cook until corn is tenderized but not overly soft, about 45 minutes. (You can chew a kernel up to test, or break one open: It's done when the kernel looks mostly hydrated but still has a tiny core of visible starchiness.) The timing can vary based on corn type, so start checking at 30 minutes and continue cooking beyond 45 minutes if it's still too raw. Top up with water as needed to keep corn submerged.

Remove from heat, cover pot, and let corn stand at room temperature overnight. The bran on the corn should now rub off easily. Drain corn in a colander, set under running cold water, and rub kernels vigorously between hands to remove most of the bran; corn should turn a brighter shade as bran comes off. Allow to drain well, then transfer corn to a food processor.

Process corn at high speed, adding as much water as you need, little by little, to help the blades process the corn, about 10 minutes; scrape down the sides of the bowl at least a few times during processing. The dough is ready when no large corn chunks remain and the purée has the texture of a thick hummus.

Scrape corn dough into a mixing bowl and add masa harina, little by little, working it in with your hands, until corn dough has the texture of Play-Doh: soft and supple, but not wet. To test texture, roll a small ball of dough between your hands, then press it between your fingers: If the edges crack, it's too dry, but if it sticks to your skin, it's too wet. Work in more water or masa harina, little by little, until you hit that sweet spot.

Cut 2 sides plus the zipper-top off of a zipper-lock bag, leaving it attached on only 1 side; line tortilla press with the plastic and trim to fit. Preheat well-seasoned griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Working with one piece at a time, roll a portion of corn dough into a golf ball–sized ball, then flatten slightly. Set portioned corn dough between the sheets of plastic, then press flat using the tortilla press. Try not to press so hard that the tortilla edge becomes too thin; about 1mm in thickness or slightly less is what you want. Rotate plastic 180 degrees and press again to ensure even thickness.

Carefully peel tortilla from plastic and place in preheated skillet. Cook until bottom side is dried, about 30 seconds, then flip using a thin metal spatula and cook other side until dried, about 30 seconds longer; tortilla may puff up and brown lightly in spots, which is fine. Adjust heat as necessary to prevent scorching. (If tortillas start to stick to griddle or skillet, rub cooking surface with a paper towel lightly moistened with vegetable oil, then buff away any excess oiliness.)

Stack tortillas as they are done, keeping them wrapped in a clean kitchen towel or tortilla holder to trap heat and steam. Serve immediately.","Bread,Mexican,Gluten-free,Corn,Tacos",https://www.seriouseats.com/nixtamalized-corn-tortilla-masa-recipe
Mexican-Style Flour Tortillas Recipe,Christian Reynoso,Mexican,"11 ounces (315g) all-purpose flour (about 2 1/2 cups), plus more for dusting

2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (8g); for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon sugar

1/2 cup lard (115g), melted

3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons (220ml) whole milk, warmed to 125°F (50°C) on an instant-read thermometer","In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add flour, sea salt, baking powder, and sugar. Turn mixer to low speed and mix until dry ingredients are well combined, about 30 seconds. Turn off mixer, detach whisk, and use it to scrape down bowl to quickly incorporate any unmixed flour.

Attach the paddle attachment. Turn mixer to low. Add half the lard in a slow stream, then turn mixer up to medium speed and slowly pour in the remaining lard until fat is incorporated and flour becomes crumbly but still soft and powdery to the touch.

With the mixer still at medium speed, add milk in intervals, pouring it steadily in 3-second additions followed by 3-second pauses to allow the milk to mix in. Repeat until all the milk has been added. Increase mixer speed to high and let run until dough is smooth and elastic, 3 minutes.

Using bench scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough into a clean medium mixing bowl, cover with plastic, and let rest at room temperature for at least 1 and up to 2 hours.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Dust a work surface with flour. Turn dough out onto work surface and divide evenly into 12 portions (about 1 3/4 ounces, or 50 grams, each). Working with 1 dough portion at a time and keeping the rest covered with a clean kitchen towel to prevent drying, dust the dough portion, then gently roll it into a ball; transfer dough ball to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough portions, then wrap baking sheet tightly with plastic. Let stand 15 minutes.

Heat a dry 10-inch cast iron pan over medium heat; make sure to have a plastic bag, clean kitchen towel, or tortilla warmer nearby to hold the cooked tortillas. Lightly flour the work surface once more. Working with one dough ball at a time and keeping the rest covered with plastic to prevent drying, place a ball on the work surface and sprinkle lightly with flour. Gently press the ball down with your palm to make a flattened puck shape.

Using a rolling pin and working from the center of the puck toward its top edge, gently roll out the dough ball, being careful not to roll past the top edge. Roll the rolling pin back toward the bottom edge, being careful not to roll past the bottom edge. Flip the dough over and rotate it 45 degrees clockwise. Dust with more flour, if needed, then repeat rolling process. Continue to flip, rotate, flour, and roll the dough until a roughly 8-inch round tortilla has formed.

Transfer tortilla to preheated pan and let cook until tortilla begins to bubble, about 10 seconds. Continue cooking about 15 second longer, until brown spots have developed on bottom side, then flip tortilla and cook on second side until browned and blistered in spots, about 10 seconds, adjusting heat as necessary to lightly brown the tortilla without burning it. Place the tortilla in the plastic bag (or tortilla warmer or wrapped in the clean towel) to keep warm and prevent drying. Repeat the rolling and cooking process with the remaining dough balls. Use tortillas as soon as possible after cooking.","Mexican,Bread,Stovetop,Tacos",https://www.seriouseats.com/flour-tortillas-northern-mexico
Charcoal-Grilled Al Pastor Skewers Recipe,Sasha Marx,Mexican,"For the Pork:

2 ancho chilies (40g), stemmed and seeded

2 pasilla or guajillo chilies (15g), stemmed and seeded

1/2 cup (120ml) homemade chicken stock or low-sodium store-bought broth

2 teaspoons (10ml) vegetable oil

1 teaspoon (2g) dried Mexican oregano

1 teaspoon (3g) ground cumin

1 tablespoon (12g) achiote powder or paste

1 chipotle chili in adobo (15g), plus 2 teaspoons (10ml) adobo sauce

1/4 cup (60ml) distilled white vinegar

2 1/2 teaspoons (10g) kosher salt

2 teaspoons (10g) sugar

3 medium garlic cloves (15g)

2 pounds (900g) pork butt, in one piece

For the Skewers and Serving:

1 small pineapple (around 2 pounds; 900g), peeled, cored, and cut into 1- by 1/4-inch pieces

Lime wedges, for serving

Finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems (optional)

Salsa verde, for serving (optional)","For the Pork: In a large, dry saucepan, toast ancho and pasilla chilies over medium-high heat, turning chilies occasionally, until puffed, pliable, lightly browned in spots, and very aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock (it should boil immediately), then pour contents of saucepan into a small heatproof bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set aside.

Wipe out saucepan, add oil, and return to medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Add cumin, oregano, and achiote and cook, stirring frequently, until spices are bloomed and aromatic but not browned, about 30 seconds. Stir in chipotle and adobo sauce and cook for 30 seconds longer. Stir in vinegar, salt, and sugar, and remove saucepan from heat.

Transfer contents of saucepan to a blender along with garlic and chilies with their steeping liquid. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, scraping down sides of blender jar with a rubber spatula as needed, about 1 minute. Set aside.

Freeze pork for 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes (partially freezing the pork makes it easier to slice). Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice pork against the grain into 2-inch-long, 1-inch-wide, and 1/8-inch-thick strips. The easiest and most efficient way to do this is to start by portioning the pork butt into 2-inch-wide by 1-inch-thick pieces, and then slicing those pieces crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick strips.

Combine pork and marinade in a large bowl, and using hands, toss until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36 hours.

For the Skewers and Serving: Thread one piece of pork onto a skewer, piercing it through twice to secure it, then bunching meat tightly together like an accordion. Then thread one piece of pineapple onto skewer. Continue alternating pieces of pork with pineapple, ending the skewer with a piece of pork. Make sure meat and pineapple are bunched tightly together, leaving no parts of the skewer exposed except for a 2-inch handle at the bottom, and the pointy tip at the top. Repeat skewering process with remaining pork and pineapple.

Set up grill for skewers, making sure to adjust distance between bricks to the length of your skewers. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly in the channel between the bricks.

Place skewers directly over the hot coals, balancing them on top of the bricks, with the handles overhanging the bricks closest to you, and the tips balancing on the farther wall of bricks. Cook, turning frequently, until pork and pineapple are lightly charred, and a piece of pork looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, 8 to 10 minutes; if flare-ups occur, move the skewers around as needed to get them away from the flames. Transfer to serving platter and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately, passing lime wedges, as well as cilantro and salsa (if using), at the table.

Warm corn or flour tortillas, lime wedges, diced onion, fresh cilantro, and avocado, for serving","Place dried ancho and guajillo chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave until pliable and toasty-smelling, 10 to 20 seconds. Transfer to the jar of a blender and add chipotle peppers, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, soy sauce, fish sauce, garlic, cilantro, cumin seed, coriander seed, and brown sugar. Blend until a smooth sauce has formed, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Transfer half of the salsa to a large bowl and the other half to a sealed container. Set aside the sealed container in the refrigerator.

Add an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the salsa in the bowl. It should taste slightly saltier than is comfortable to taste. Add 1 piece of steak to bowl and turn to coat. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with the top folded over to prevent excess sauce and meat juices from contaminating the seal. Repeat with remaining steak, adding it all to the same bag. Pour any excess marinade over the steak. Squeeze all air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.

When ready to cook, remove the extra salsa from the fridge to allow it to warm up a little. Light one chimney full of charcoal.

1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt

1/4 teaspoon (1g) baking powder

4 ounces cold unsalted butter (1 stick; 115g), cut into 1/4-inch pieces

2 large egg yolks, cold

1 recipe Cajeta Casera (see note)","Split vanilla bean lengthwise with a paring knife and scrape out seeds with the flat of the blade; reserve empty pod for cajeta or another use. Combine vanilla seeds with flour, tapioca starch, powdered sugar, salt, baking powder, and butter in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to form a fine and sandy meal, then add egg yolks and continue processing until the dough balls up around the blade. Divide in half and proceed to step 2, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate up to 1 week.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Turn a portion of dough onto a powdered sugar–dusted surface and dust more powdered sugar on top. Roll dough until roughly 6 inches across, then dust with powdered sugar, flip upside down, and dust again. Continue rolling until dough is just shy of 1/4 inch thick. Slide a thin offset spatula under dough to loosen any places that might have stuck and cut dough into 2-inch rounds. Arrange cutouts on a parchment-lined aluminum half-sheet pan, leaving about 1/2 inch between cookies. Gather the scraps, briefly knead, and re-roll and cut as before. Repeat with remaining dough, for a total of 50 pieces. Bake until just beginning to brown around the edges, about 15 minutes, and cool to room temperature directly on sheet pan.

French fries, for serving

Cooked long-grain rice, for serving","Cut the beef across the grain into roughly 1/2-inch-thick strips.

In a wok or large cast iron or stainless steel skillet, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over high heat until heavily smoking. Meanwhile, season beef all over with salt.

Working in batches, add just enough beef to the pan to sear it heavily without steaming in its own juices. Spread the beef around so the pieces are evenly spaced apart and allow to cook until very well seared and charred on one side, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir and toss beef so that it cooks all over, about 30 seconds longer; if you are working over a gas flame and aren't afraid of some fire, toss the beef near the flame so that the oil briefly combusts in big bursts. (If this makes you nervous, don't allow it to catch fire. Instead, manage the heat to prevent flare-ups.) Using a spatula, transfer beef to a platter to rest. Repeat with remaining beef, always getting the pan smoking-hot before the next batch and adding more oil if needed.

When all the beef is cooked, return the empty pan to high heat. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and heat until smoking. Working in batches, add just enough red onion so that it sears and browns rapidly without steaming, about 30 seconds. Toss a few times until the onion is crisp-tender. Using a spatula, transfer onion to a platter. Repeat with remaining onion, always heating the pan until smoking first and adding more oil if necessary.

Return the empty pan to high heat, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil, and heat until smoking. Working in batches if necessary, add scallions and cook, without stirring, until seared on bottom side, about 30 seconds. Push scallions to the side and add peppers. Cook until seared, about 30 seconds longer.

Push scallions and peppers to the side and add tomatoes to the pan, allowing them to sear on one side, about 30 seconds. (If your burner isn't very strong, you can remove the scallions and peppers from the pan before adding the tomatoes to guarantee good searing. Otherwise, leave them in.) Try not to let the tomatoes grow too soft and pulpy; it's better that they retain their shape rather than brown to the point of becoming mushy.

Add garlic and ginger and cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until lightly sautéed and fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add soy sauce and vinegar and toss to combine.

Return beef and all accumulated juices to the pan along with the red onions. (If you've removed the scallions and peppers, add them back now, too.) Add cilantro. Toss over high heat to combine well, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go. Remove from heat.

Peruvian-Style Grilled Chicken With Green Sauce Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Mexican,"For the Sauce:

3 whole jalapeño chilies, roughly chopped (see note)

1 tablespoon (15ml) ají amarillo pepper paste (see note)

1 cup fresh cilantro leaves (1 ounce; 28g)

2 medium cloves garlic

1/2 cup (120ml) mayonnaise

1/4 cup (60ml) sour cream

2 teaspoons (10ml) fresh juice from 1 lime

1 teaspoon (5ml) distilled white vinegar

2 tablespoons (30ml) extra virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Chicken:

1 whole chicken, 3 1/2 to 4 pounds (1.6 to 1.8kg)

4 teaspoons (20g) kosher salt

2 tablespoons (30g) ground cumin

2 tablespoons (30g) paprika

1 teaspoon (5g) freshly ground black pepper

3 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)

2 tablespoons (30ml) white vinegar

2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable or canola oil","For the Sauce: Combine jalapeños, ají amarillo (if using), cilantro, garlic, mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and vinegar in the jar of a blender. Blend on high speed, scraping down as necessary, until smooth. With blender running, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sauce will be quite loose at this point, but will thicken as it sits. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use.

For the Chicken: Pat chicken dry with paper towels and place on a large cutting board, breast side down. Using sharp kitchen shears, remove backbone by cutting along either side of it. Turn chicken over and lay out flat. Press firmly on breast to flatten chicken. For added stability, run a metal or wooden skewer horizontally through chicken, entering through one thigh, going through both breast halves, and exiting through other thigh. Tuck wing tips behind back.

Combine salt, cumin, paprika, pepper, garlic, vinegar, and oil in a small bowl and massage with fingertips until homogeneous. Spread mixture evenly over all surfaces of chicken.

Light 1 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate.

Place chicken, skin side up, on cooler side of grill, with legs facing toward hotter side. Cover grill, with vents on lid open and aligned over chicken. Open bottom vents of grill. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 110°F (43°C). Carefully flip chicken and place, skin side down, on hotter side of grill, with breasts pointed toward cooler side. Press down firmly with a wide, stiff spatula to ensure good contact between bird and grill grates. Cover and cook until skin is crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 145 to 150°F (63 to 66°C), about 10 minutes longer. If chicken threatens to burn before temperature is achieved, carefully slide to cooler side of grill, cover, and continue to cook until done. Do not leave the lid off for longer than it takes to check temperature, or chicken will burn.

Transfer chicken to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Carve and serve with sauce.","Grilled Chicken,Peruvian,Whole Chicken,Memorial Day,Summer Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/peruvian-style-grilled-chicken-with-green-sauce-recipe

Homemade Ricotta Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,Barbecue Cuisine,"1/2 gallon (1.9L) whole milk, not ultra-pasteurized (see note)

Pinch kosher salt, optional (see note)

2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons (40ml) distilled white vinegar or fresh lemon juice (see note)","Fill a pot with the milk. Stir in salt, if using. Heat over medium heat until milk registers 185°F (85°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Add vinegar or lemon juice and stir briefly to incorporate. Curds should begin forming almost immediately; stop stirring as soon as they've formed throughout the pot.

Without stirring, continue to hold curdled-milk mixture at 185°F for 20 minutes. It's okay if the temperature fluctuates down to 175°F (79°C) or up to 190°F (88°C), but try to keep it in that zone for the full 20 minutes.

Line a fine-mesh strainer with paper towels or cheesecloth. Using a slotted spoon, transfer curds to strainer and let stand until excess liquid has drained away. Exactly how long to let it drain depends on whether you want a moister final product or a drier one. Do not try to pour all the milky liquid through the strainer, as this will clog it and prevent the liquid from flowing through.

Easy Roasted-Garlic Focaccia Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Barbecue Cuisine,"For the Focaccia:

1 whole head garlic

5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided

Kosher salt, for seasoning

500g all-purpose or bread flour (17 1/2 ounces; about 3 1/4 cups)

15g kosher salt (1/2 ounce; about 1 tablespoon)

4g instant yeast (0.15 ounce; about 1 teaspoon)

325g water (11 1/2 ounces; about 1 1/2 cups minus 1 tablespoon)

For the Garlic Butter:

2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter

2 teaspoons dried oregano

1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes","For the Focaccia: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Remove 4 cloves garlic from head and set aside. Place remaining head in the center of a sheet of aluminum foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil and season with salt. Wrap tightly with foil and place in an oven-safe cast iron, carbon steel, or stainless steel skillet, then transfer to oven. Roast until garlic is completely tender, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and refrigerate until ready to use the next day.

Combine flour, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. (To account for rising, the bowl should be at least 4 to 6 times the volume of the dough.) Mix with hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains.

Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that edges are well sealed, then let rest on the countertop for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.

Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil to a 12-inch cast iron skillet or large cake pan. Transfer dough to pan by tipping it out of the bowl in one large blob. Turn dough to coat in oil. Using a flat palm, press dough around skillet, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom and sides of pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough stand at room temperature for 2 hours. After the first hour, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C).

At the end of the 2 hours, dough should mostly fill skillet, up to its edge. Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills every corner, popping any large bubbles that appear. Lift up one edge of dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape. Repeat, moving around dough, until no air bubbles are left underneath and dough is evenly spread around skillet. Peel roasted garlic cloves and break up large cloves into 2 or 3 pieces each. Scatter roasted garlic evenly over surface of dough, then push down on each clove until it is embedded in a deep well of dough.

Transfer skillet to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and bottom appears golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 16 to 24 minutes. If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan on a burner and cook over medium heat, moving pan around to cook evenly, until bottom of focaccia is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, Make the Garlic Butter: Mince 4 reserved raw cloves of garlic. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil with butter in a small skillet and melt over medium-low heat. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant and garlic is just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl and season with salt.

When focaccia has finished baking, spread garlic butter over top with a spoon. Transfer to a cutting board, allow to cool slightly, slice, and serve. Extra bread should be stored in a brown paper bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 300°F (150°C) oven for about 10 minutes before serving.","Yeast Breads,Italian,Garlic,Sides",https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-roasted-garlic-focaccia-no-knead-bread-recipe

8 fresh cilantro sprigs, cut into 1-inch pieces","For the Broth: Sprinkle lamb evenly on all sides with salt and place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

In a stovetop pressure cooker set over medium-high heat or in an electric pressure cooker set to sauté mode, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil until smoking. Working in batches, brown lamb on all sides, about 8 minutes; transfer to a heatproof bowl. Pour off fat in pressure cooker into a heatproof bowl and reserve. Return cooker to heat (or sauté mode), stir in wine, and cook, scraping up any browned bits with wooden spoon, until alcohol has cooked off, about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken stock and water. Return lamb to pot along with any accumulated juices.

Lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over high heat. Once cooker has reached high pressure, cook for 40 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure (if using a stovetop pressure cooker; electric ones will automatically regulate the heat and pressure level).

Depressurize the cooker using the quick-release method, then carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you. Strain broth through fine-mesh strainer into clean heatproof container, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; transfer lamb to work surface. When lamb is cool enough to handle, separate meat from bones, discarding bones.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in now-empty pressure cooker over medium heat (or using an electric cooker's sauté mode) until shimmering. Add scallions, garlic, ginger, and star anise and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in strained broth, bring to boil, and simmer until fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt.

For the Topping: Meanwhile, add oil, reserved lamb fat, and minced garlic to medium saucepan set over medium-high heat and cook until garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chilies, cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, and white pepper. Let mixture cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk in dark soy sauce and sugar. Gently stir in reserved lamb meat until lightly shredded and incorporated. Season with salt.

To Serve: Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard scallions, garlic, ginger, and star anise pods from broth. Bring large pot of unsalted water to boil over high heat. If making your own hand-pulled noodles, prepare them now; otherwise, proceed with cooking store-bought noodles. Place in pot of boiling water, stirring gently with chopsticks or tongs to prevent sticking. Add about 1 1/2 cups (360ml) hot broth to serving bowls.

When noodles are cooked, drain thoroughly with fine-mesh strainer or noodle basket, shaking off as much excess water as possible, then place noodles in each bowl of hot broth. Stir noodles with chopsticks or tongs, then lift and fold noodles over. Spoon 1/2 cup shredded lamb mixture with some of its sauce over noodles. Sprinkle with sliced scallions and cilantro. Serve immediately.","Chinese,Braised & Stewed Lamb,Lamb Shank,Noodles,Soups",https://www.seriouseats.com/shredded-lamb-noodle-soup
Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Barbecue Cuisine,"For the Broth:

3 pounds chicken backs or wings

1/2 pound Chinese ham or slab bacon

6 scallions, whites separated, greens roughly chopped

1-inch knob ginger

1 tablespoon white peppercorns

Kosher salt

For the Filling:

1/3 pound ground pork

1/4 pound raw shrimp, peeled

2 teaspoons soy sauce

1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine

2 teaspoons sugar

For the Dough:

2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour

1 cup boiling water

For Cooking:

Napa cabbage leaves","Combine chicken bones, ham, scallion whites, half of scallion greens, ginger, and white peppercorns in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and simmer for 2 1/2 hours. Strain broth, season to taste with salt, cover, and refrigerate until set into a semi-firm jelly, at least 8 hours.

Meanwhile, combine pork, shrimp, soy sauce, wine, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and remaining scallion greens in a food processor. Process until a fine paste is formed, about 12 to 15 one-second pulses. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Meanwhile, place flour in bowl of food processor. With machine running, slowly drizzle in water until cohesive dough is formed (you probably won't need all the water). Allow dough to ride around processor for 30 seconds. Form into a ball using floured hands and transfer to a bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for at least 30 minutes.

When broth is gelled, transfer filling mixture to a bowl along with 1 cup of jellied broth (save the rest for another use). Beat or whisk it in until homogenous. Keep filling well chilled.

Divide dough into 4 sections, and each section into 10 small tablespoon-sized balls, making 40 balls total. On a well-floured work surface, roll each ball into a round, flat wrapper, 3 1/2- to 4-inches in diameter. Stack wrappers and keep under plastic until all of them are rolled out.

To form dumplings, place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of a wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with a wet fingertip or a pastry brush. Pleat edges of the wrapper repeatedly, pinching the edge closed after each pleat until the entire dumpling is sealed in a cinched purse shape. Pinch and twist top to seal. Transfer sealed dumplings to a lightly floured wooden or parchment-lined board.

Place a bamboo steamer over a wok with 2 inches of water. Place over medium high heat until simmering. Line steamer with napa cabbage leaves and place dumplings directly on leaves. Steam until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, being careful not to break them.","Chinese,Chicken,Pork,Shrimp,Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/soup-dumplings-xiao-long-bao-recipe

1 tablespoon sugar

1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic (about 3 medium cloves)

1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

To Cook and Serve:

2 tablespoons lightly crushed roasted peanuts (optional)

2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro leaves and fine stems","For the Wontons: Combine pork, salt, sugar, white pepper, scallions, garlic, and wine in a medium bowl and knead and turn with clean hands until the mixture is homogenous and starting to feel tacky/sticky, about 1 minute. Transfer a teaspoon-sized amount to a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power until cooked through, about 10 seconds. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt, white pepper, and/or sugar if desired.

Set up a work station with a small bowl of water, a clean dish towel for wiping your fingers, a bowl with the wonton filling, a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet for the finished wontons, and a stack of wonton wrappers covered in plastic wrap.

To form dumplings hold one wrapper on top of a flat hand. Using a spoon, place a 2 teaspoon- to 1 tablespoon-sized amount of filling in the center of the wrapper. Use the tip of the finger on your other hand to very gently moisten the edge of the wrapper with water (do not use too much water). Wipe fingertip dry on kitchen towel.

Carefully fold one tip of the wonton wrapper across to meet the opposite tip to form a triangle. Seal edges of the triangle, carefully pushing out all air from within the wrapper as you work. Pull the two corners on the hypotenuse of the newly formed triangle to meet, moistening one with a little water, crossing them and pinching to seal (see here for more detailed step by step instructions). Transfer finished dumplings to the parchment lined baking sheet.

For the Sauce: Place chilies and Sichuan peppercorns on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high until toasted and aromatic, about 15 seconds. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or a food processor and crush until it's about the texture of store-bought crushed red pepper flakes. Transfer to a small saucepan.

1 teaspoon (4g) MSG (optional)

2 tablespoons (20g) sugar

2 1/2 cups (500g) peanut oil, or any other neutral oil

2 cups (200g) thinly sliced shallots (about 1mm thick)

3/4 cup (65g) thinly sliced garlic (about 1mm thick)","Put on disposable latex gloves.

Place a wire rack inside a quarter- or half-sheet tray. Using your hands and kitchen shears, cut open chilies and place them on rack. Shake rack to sift off most of the seeds (don't worry about removing all the seeds). Transfer chilies to a bowl and discard seeds.

Using a spice grinder and working in batches, process chilies until they are ground to a size just larger than standard chili flakes. Transfer processed chilies to a heatproof bowl or pot large enough to accommodate bubbling oil (at least 4 quarts in size). Combine chili flakes with peanuts, ginger, black pepper, star anise, cardamom, cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, mushroom powder, salt, MSG (if using), and sugar. Set aside.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a 2-quart heatproof bowl. In a 4-quart saucepan, combine oil and shallots. Cook over high heat while constantly stirring. Once shallots become light golden brown, strain. Pour oil back into pot and add garlic. Cook over medium-low heat, constantly stirring, until light golden brown, then strain. Return oil to pot once more. Set aside fried shallots and garlic.

Heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Pour hot oil over chilies, spices, and other seasonings. Stir well to distribute hot oil throughout. Set aside to fully cool, about 30 minutes or until bowl or pot is cool to the touch.

Once chili-and-oil mixture has fully cooled, remove star anise and cardamom pods. Mix in fried shallots and garlic. Pour finished chili crisp into jars and store in the fridge for about 3 months. It can be served immediately, but for best flavor, eat it the next day. Stir well before serving.","Condiments & Sauces,Chinese,Garlic,Peppers",https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp

2 tablespoons (30ml) soy sauce

2 tablespoons (24g) brown sugar

2 pieces whole star anise","Place shrimp and scallops in separate medium microwave-safe bowls and cover with at least 2 inches of boiling water. Set aside to soak for a minimum of 1 hour or up to 2 hours. (Alternatively, you can soak the shrimp and scallops in cold water overnight in the refrigerator.)

Drain shrimp completely. Drain scallops, leaving 2 tablespoons (30ml) soaking water along with the scallops in the bowl. Cover bowl with a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high heat until scallops are tender and easily break apart when pinched between your fingers, about 3 minutes.

Drain scallops of remaining liquid and transfer them to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse scallops 7 times, until just broken into thin strands, then transfer back to their original bowl. Add shrimp to food processor and pulse 10 times, until coarsely chopped. Transfer shrimp back to their original bowl. Finally, combine garlic, shallots, ginger, and Thai chilies in food processor bowl and pulse 12 to 15 times, until finely chopped but not puréed. Set mixture aside.

In a large Dutch oven, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add ham and cook, stirring frequently with a heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon, until ham is crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.

Add scallops to pot and continue to cook, stirring frequently to separate strands, until scallops are lightly golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shrimp and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until seafood is a deep golden color, 7 to 10 minutes. The oil in the pot will be very bubbly during this stage, making it difficult to see what is going on in the bottom of the pot, so you will need to occasionally use your spatula or a slotted spoon to pick a spoonful of the mixture up out of the oil to check its color.

Add vegetable mixture to pot and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are golden brown and fond begins to form at the bottom of the pot, 8 to 10 minutes. Add ground dried chilies and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Deglaze with Shaoxing wine, scraping up any brown bits stuck to the pot.

Stir in chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and star anise and continue to cook at a rapid simmer until mixture is thickened and most of the liquid has been absorbed into the sauce, leaving a thin layer of bubbling oil on the surface of the pot, 12 to 15 minutes.

Lift pork shoulder and remove wire rack, then set shoulder directly on rimmed baking sheet. Turn pork shoulder fat cap side down. Rub a generous and even coating of mustard and hot sauce (if desired) all over the exposed sides of the pork shoulder.

Sprinkle dry rub evenly all over the slathered sides of the shoulder, creating a coating that's thorough but not too heavy. Turn pork shoulder fat cap side up. Repeat slathering and sprinkling of dry rub on that final side.

Preheat smoker to 225°F (107°C) and prepare with the hardwood of your choice. (How you do this will depend on your smoker; some burn logs of wood, some burn charcoal with wood chunks or chips sprinkled on top, some burn pellets, some are electric, and some use gas.) You'll want to maintain a relatively even 225°F temperature for the duration of the cooking time, with a continuous supply of clean smoke. (The smoke should look like thin blue wisps, not heavy white clouds.)

Set pork in smoker, fat cap side up. Fill a disposable aluminum roasting pan with an inch or two of water and set it in the smoker as well. If your smoker doesn't have a drip tray, put the pan of water below the pork to catch grease; if it does, set the tray wherever there's space.

Smoke pork shoulder until a leave-in probe thermometer registers 195°F (90°C) in the center; make sure the thermometer is not touching a bone. This can take roughly 12 to 15 hours. It's impossible to give a more precise time estimate, since this depends on several variables, including how even the smoker temperature is, the size and thickness of the shoulder, and other factors. A boneless shoulder will cook faster than a bone-in one, but in either case, monitor the temperature frequently as it approaches its goal. Remove pork shoulder from smoker and let rest 20 minutes.

Using two forks or a set of bear claws, shred pork into thin, stringy strands, breaking up any un-rendered fat into small pieces. Discard bones and/or butcher's twine used to truss a deboned shoulder (see note) as you find them. Break up the bark (the dark crust on the pork) into small pieces and mix into the pulled pork. Mix well again to distribute the bark and fat. Chop pork more finely, if desired.

Sprinkle barbecue sauce on top of pork to your taste, stirring to mix it in thoroughly. Season with additional salt, if desired.

Pile pulled pork onto potato buns, then top with coleslaw. Close sandwiches and serve, passing more barbecue sauce at the table.","Pork,Barbecue,Grilled Pork,Summer Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/real-barbecued-pulled-pork

Cook shrimp 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, depending on size, and add remaining seafood seasoning and salt and pepper to taste. When shrimp are finished cooking, the liquid should have a sauce consistency.

Quickly whisk in the butter, turning the heat down as necessary, until it is melted into the sauce, leaving it thick and emulsified. Taste and add salt and pepper if desired. Remove lemon quarters.

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil

1 pound (about 450g) cooked sausage, such as Andouille, kielbasa, or hot dogs, cut into 1/2-inch disks

1 large onion, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 340g)

1 green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)

4 ribs celery, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)

4 medium cloves garlic, minced or smashed in a mortar and pestle

Freshly ground black pepper

1 smoked ham hock, smoked turkey leg, or any small hunk of smoked pork, such as ham or a smoked pork chop (optional)

3 bay leaves

1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Hot sauce, such as Crystal or Frank's, to taste

Cooked white rice, for serving","Place beans in a large bowl and cover with 6 cups (1.5L) cold water. Set aside at room temperature for 8 to 16 hours. Drain and rinse. Now would be a good time to have kids pick out a few beans to grow into sprouts.

In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sausage, onion, bell pepper, and celery. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until vegetables have softened and are just starting to brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. If you’ve got a helper stool that lets your kids get up to stovetop level, consider letting them stir with a towel in their hand while you steady the pot. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 45 seconds.

Grind some black pepper into a small bowl, then stir it into the pot, stirring and sniffing until it gives off fragrant aroma, about 30 seconds. Add beans, along with enough water to cover by about 2 inches (roughly 6 to 8 cups), smoked pork or turkey (if using), and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Cover and cook until beans are completely tender, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. (Older beans can take longer.)

Remove the lid and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has thickened and turned creamy, about 20 minutes. If the pot starts to look dry before the stew turns creamy, add a cup of water and continue simmering. When it’s nice and creamy, stir in the cider vinegar, then have your little helpers taste a spoonful and ask them if it needs any salt. Double check for yourself, add more salt as necessary, and then bring the whole pot to the table.

Clemenceau'd Shrimp from 'Treme',Kate Williams,Barbecue Cuisine,"18 large or 24 medium Gulf shrimp, heads intact

1 1/2 pounds baby new potatoes, preferably some combination of red, white, yellow, and purple

4 ounces enoki or cremini mushrooms, wiped clean

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Sea salt and freshly ground pepper

2 fresh thyme sprigs

6 cloves garlic, unpeeled, lightly smashed

1 pound sugar snap peas, ends trimmed

2 Meyer lemons

3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons

3 tablespoons canola oil","Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Peel and devein the shrimp, making sure to keep the heads attached. Arrange the peeled shrimp in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Scrub the potatoes (but do not peel), pat dry, and place them in a large mixing bowl. Add the mushrooms. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss gently to mix well and coat evenly with the oil. Spread them in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Scatter the thyme sprigs and crushed garlic on top. Roast until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. (The potatoes can be made up to 1 day ahead.)

Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. While the water is heating, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl halfway with ice, then adding enough water just to cover the ice. Add the peas to the boiling water and blanch just until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain the peas and immediately plunge them into the ice bath to stop the cooking and preserve their color. Using a slotted spoon, remove them from the ice bath and set aside.

Using a microplane or the smallest holes on a box grater, finely grate the lemon zest. Set aside the zest. Using a sharp paring knife, remove the skins of the lemons and discard. Over a small bowl, supreme the lemons by gently cutting in between each segment to remove the flesh, letting the segments fall into the bowl as you work. Squeeze the rinds and pulp over the lemon supremes to extract any remaining juice, and discard the peels. Set aside.

Bring 1/4 cup water to boil in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the cold butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all the butter is melted and a fully emulsified sauce forms. Season to taste with salt. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

If the potatoes were cooked ahead of time, rewarm them in a 350°F oven. Place the cooked sugar snap peas in a medium saucepan with 2 tablespoons water and heat over medium-high heat until hot. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the butter sauce over the peas and toss to coat. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Remove the tray of shrimp from the refrigerator. Divide the canola oil between 2 large nonstick skillets and heat over medium-high heat. (Alternatively, you can cook the shrimp in 1 pan but in 2 batches; what’s important is to avoid overcrowding the pan.) Season the shrimp on both sides with salt and pepper. Add the shrimp to the hot pans and sear until the shrimp start to turn opaque, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Turn the shrimp and continue cooking just until cooked through, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes longer.

Arrange the potatoes and a spoonful of sugar snap peas in the center of each of six large plates, along with 3 or 4 shrimp. Stir the lemon segments, zest, and juice into the butter sauce and spoon the sauce over and around the shrimp.

The Nasty Bits: Turkey Neck Gumbo Recipe,Chichi Wang,Barbecue Cuisine,"3 pounds turkey necks, fresh, smoked or a combination thereof

1 1/4 cups vegetable oil

1 1/2 cups all purpose flour

1 medium onion, cut into small dice

5 celery stalks, cut into medium dice

1 poblano chile, stemmed, seeded, and cut into small dice

1 jalepeno pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped

2 green bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into medium dice

3 garlic cloves, minced

1 tablespoon salt

1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper

1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder

1 teaspoon paprika

3 quarts chicken or turkey stock

1 pound andouille sausage, slice into 1-inch chunks

1 pound okra, sliced into 1/2 - inch segments","With a heavy cleaver, chop the turkey necks into 3-inch segments and set aside.

To make the roux: heat the 1 1/4 cups of vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, whisk in the 1 1/2 cups flour and reduce the heat to medium. Cook, whisking constantly and slowly until the roux has thickened and is very dark brown. This process should take 40 minutes to one hour. At some point, you may want to switch from a whisk to a spatula or wooden spoon for ease of use. 20 minutes into cooking, reduce the heat to low and take care that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot; this may require that you use both a whisk and a spatula to periodically check the bottom of the pot.

When the roux has darkened to the appropriate shade of brown, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, jalapeno and poblano, garlic, salt, black pepper, cayenne, chili powder, and paprika. The vegetables will steam and sizzle when they hit the roux. Allow the roux to cool briefly.

Add the stock to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil, incorporating the roux into the liquid. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes. Continually skim off the oil that rises to the surface.

Add the turkey necks and simmer for another hour. Add the sausage and simmer for approximately half an hour longer. At this point, the turkey meat will be fork-tender and the sausage will just have cooked through. Taste the broth. If it still has a strong roux flavor (that is, too floury or pasty), add a few more cups of stock or water.

Heat a few tablespoons more of oil in a skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the okra and sautée, stirring or flipping the okra for about 6 to 8 minutes until it's lightly browned and the slime has cooked off. Add the okra to the gumbo and simmer for an additional 15 minutes.

The gumbo is finished when there is no more oil that can be skimmed from the top. Serve with rice.","Turkey,Cajun & Creole,Braised & Stewed Turkey,Soups,Thanksgiving Dinner",https://www.seriouseats.com/the-nasty-bits-turkey-neck-gumbo-recipe

Shrimp Étouffée Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,Barbecue Cuisine,"For the Shrimp Stock (see note):

2 pounds (900g) shell-on shrimp, or 3 pounds (1.4kg) head-on shrimp (small or large shrimp will work in this recipe; size doesn't matter)

2 teaspoons (8g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable or canola oil

1 medium yellow onion, diced

2 large ribs celery, diced

4 medium cloves garlic, smashed

2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste

1/2 cup (120ml) dry sherry or brandy (optional)

1 bay leaf

A few sprigs flat-leaf parsley

4 sprigs thyme

For the Étouffée:

1/2 cup (4 ounces; 115g) unsalted butter

1/2 cup (2 1/4 ounces; 65g) all-purpose flour

1 (8-ounce; 225g) medium yellow onion, diced

2 large ribs celery (6 ounces; 170g), diced

1 (8-ounce; 225g) large green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced (or, if you want a sweeter flavor, half of a large green bell pepper and half of a large red bell pepper)

4 medium cloves garlic, coarsely chopped

3 scallions, white and light-green parts only, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish

1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1/4 teaspoon onion powder

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1/8 teaspoon hot paprika (optional)

3 cups (700ml) shrimp stock, plus more as needed

2 bay leaves

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Warm long-grain rice, for serving","For the Shrimp Stock (see note): Peel and devein shrimp, reserving the shrimp shells; if using head-on shrimp, twist off the heads and reserve with the shells. In a medium bowl, combine peeled shrimp with the 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and stir well. Refrigerate shrimp until it's time to add them to the étouffée.

In a heavy-bottomed stockpot or Dutch oven, heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp shells and heads (if using) and cook, stirring constantly and scraping up any browned bits as they form on the bottom of the pot, until it becomes difficult to remove the browned bits and it seems they could start to burn, about 4 minutes; lower heat at any point if necessary to avoid burning.

Add onion, celery, and garlic and continue to cook, stirring and scraping, until softened. Add tomato paste and stir well until incorporated. If using sherry or brandy, add it to the pot and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits, then add 2 quarts (1.9L) water. (If not using sherry or brandy, just add the water right away.)

Add bay leaf, parsley, and thyme and bring to a gentle simmer, then cook for 45 minutes. Strain stock; do not skim the oil from the surface of the stock, as the oil contains a lot of the shrimp flavor and won't be a problem for the étouffée.

For the Étouffée: In a Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add flour and stir to form a smooth paste. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom very frequently, until roux turns the color of your choice: light tan, peanut butter–colored, or chocolaty brown. The color of the roux will change the flavor of the étouffée, from mild and light with a sweet shrimp flavor for a blond roux, to dark, slightly bitter, and complex for a darker brown one.

Add onion, celery, and bell pepper, then lower heat to medium and cook, stirring, until vegetables are coated in the floury paste and have softened slightly, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and scallion and cook for 1 minute.

Stir in dried oregano, dried thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and hot paprika, if using.

Add the shrimp stock in ladlefuls, stirring well to incorporate between additions. At first the stock will form a thick, gluey paste with the flour, but it will eventually thicken into a thick sauce. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain a bare simmer.

Add bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, then cover and simmer, occasionally stirring and scraping the bottom to prevent scorching, until vegetables are very soft, about 30 minutes.

Stir in shrimp and cook until they have just turned pink and are cooked through; the amount of time this takes will depend on the size of the shrimp. At this point, if the étouffée is too thick for your taste, add more stock as needed to thin it to your desired consistency.

Season étouffée with salt and pepper. Spoon into bowls or onto plates with warm rice. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and serve.","Seafood Mains,Cajun & Creole,Braised & Stewed Seafood,Shrimp",https://www.seriouseats.com/shrimp-etouffee

1 pound (450g) linguine","If Using a Mortar and Pestle: Crush the garlic in the mortar with a pinch of salt to form a paste. Add almonds and beat and crush into a rough paste. Work in basil leaves and mint (if using), pounding and crushing into tiny bits. Smash in cheese, followed by tomatoes and olive oil. The final sauce should be a rough paste. Season with salt.

If Using a Food Processor: Pulse garlic with almonds until roughly chopped. Add basil, mint (if using), cheese, tomatoes, and olive oil and process to a rough paste. Season with salt.

Transfer two-thirds of the sauce to a large heatproof serving bowl.

In a pot of salted boiling water, cook linguine until al dente. Transfer pasta to serving bowl, reserving some of the pasta-cooking water. Toss well, adding more olive oil and pasta-cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time each, until a creamy sauce forms that's not dry but also not soupy. Season with salt, if needed. If the sauce gets too dry at any point, simply add more pasta-cooking water to loosen it.

Serve, spooning remaining sauce on top of each portion and adding more cheese as desired.

Easy No-Knead Olive-Rosemary Focaccia With Pistachios Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Barbecue Cuisine,"500 grams (17 1/2 ounces, about 3 1/4 cups) all-purpose or bread flour

15 grams (.5 ounces, about 1 tablespoon) kosher salt

4 grams (.15 ounces, about 1 teaspoon) instant yeast

325 grams (11 1/2 ounces, about 1 1/2 cups minus 1 tablespoon) water

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided

4 ounces pitted green olives, sliced

1/4 cup roasted pistachios, roughly chopped or lightly pounded in a mortar and pestle

2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, very roughly chopped

Coarse sea salt","Combine flour, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. Mix with hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. The bowl should be at least 4 to 6 times the volume of the dough to account for rising.

Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that edges are well-sealed, then let rest on the countertop for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.

Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour, then transfer it to a lightly-floured work surface. Form into a ball by holding it with well-floured hands and tucking the dough underneath itself, rotating it until it forms a tight ball.

Pour half of oil in the bottom of a 12-inch cast iron skillet or large cake pan. Transfer dough to pan, turn to coat in oil, and position seam-side-down. Using a flat palm, press the dough around the skillet, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom and edges of the pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough stand at room temperature for 2 hours. After the first hour, adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 550°F.

At the end of the 2 hours, dough should mostly fill the skillet up to the edge. Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills every corner, popping any large bubbles that appear. Lift up one edge of the dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around the dough until there are no air bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread around the skillet. Spread olives and pistachios all over the surface of the dough and press down on them with your fingertips to embed slightly. Drizzle with remaining olive oil. Sprinkle with rosemary and coarse salt.

Transfer skillet to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and bottom is golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 16 to 24 minutes. Using a thin spatula, loosen focaccia and peek underneath. If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan on a burner and cook over medium heat, moving the pan around to cook evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, allow to cool slightly, slice, and serve. Extra bread should be stored in a brown paper bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 300°F oven for about 10 minutes before serving.","Italian,Vegan Snacks & Appetizers,Vegetarian Snacks & Appetizers,Yeast Breads",https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-no-knead-olive-rosemary-pistachio-focaccia-kenji-recipe
Pasta alla Gricia Recipe,Sasha Marx,Barbecue Cuisine,"8 ounces (225g) guanciale (cured pork jowl), in one piece

1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

12 ounces (340g) rigatoni

2 ounces (60g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving","Freeze guanciale for at least 15 minutes, and up to 45 minutes (partially freezing the guanciale makes it easier to slice). Using a sharp chef's knife, cut into 1/4-inch-thick planks, then cut planks into 1/4-inch-thick batons (lardons).

In a large 12-inch stainless steel skillet, heat oil over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and guanciale is golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer guanciale to a plate; set aside. Reduce heat to low, and bloom about 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in rendered guanciale fat until pepper foams and is aromatic, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat.

Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or medium pot, bring 3 quarts of water and 2 teaspoons kosher salt to a boil over high heat. Set a colander inside a large heatproof bowl in the sink. Add rigatoni to water and cook, stirring frequently during the first minute to prevent pasta from sticking.

Once pasta has cooked for 4 minutes 30 seconds, transfer 2 cups (475ml) of starchy pasta water to skillet. Return skillet to high heat and bring to a boil, swirling to emulsify pasta water with guanciale fat.

When pasta has cooked for a total of 5 minutes, drain in prepared colander, then transfer pasta to skillet (the pasta will be very undercooked at this point, but it will continue cooking in the skillet); reserve drained pasta water.

Cook rigatoni, swirling skillet constantly and gently stirring with a spoon or rubber spatula, to ensure even cooking and that the sauce remains emulsified, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and reduced, 6 to 8 minutes; if sauce reduces too much before pasta has finished cooking, add more reserved pasta water to skillet in 1/4-cup increments. Add guanciale to skillet and carefully toss to combine.

Remove from heat, add half of the grated Pecorino Romano, and toss or stir rapidly to combine. Once cheese is fully emulsified in the sauce, add remaining Pecorino Romano, and toss or stir rapidly once more to combine. Adjust sauce consistency as needed with more pasta water. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.

1 teaspoon (about 3g) minced fresh thyme leaves

3 tablespoons (45g) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes

1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce

White wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, or fresh lemon juice, to taste

Minced fresh parsley, for garnish","Combine Marsala and stock in a mixing bowl or large measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin all over surface. Set aside.

Season chicken cutlets all over with salt and pepper. Pour a roughly 1/2-inch layer of flour into a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge each cutlet in flour, tap off excess, and transfer to clean plate.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches if necessary, add chicken and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain.

Add mushrooms to skillet (do not drain remaining oil) and cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms have released their juices and browned well, about 10 minutes. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring, until shallots are translucent, about 2 minutes. Add more oil if pan seems too dry at any point.

Pour Marsala mixture into pan, making sure to scrape in all the gelatin.

To assemble:

Fifteen 4- by 8-inch sheets fresh rolled pasta, or 15 pieces no-boil lasagna noodles from 1 package (see note)

4 ounces parmesan, grated on a microplane grater (About 2 cups)

2 tablespoons minced basil or parsley (or a mix of both)","For the Ragù Bolognese: Heat butter and olive oil in large Dutch Oven over high heat, stirring occasionally, until butter has stopped foaming. Add lamb, pork, veal, and chicken livers, and cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 7-10 minutes. Remove from heat, transfer meat to strainer set in large bowl, allow to drain, then transfer drained liquid back to Dutch Oven. Add onions, carrots, celery, garlic, sage, and red pepper flakes, and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, but not browned, about 10 minutes.

Return meat to skillet, add tomatoes, wine, milk, stock, and bay leaves, and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and simmer 2 1/2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly below level of meat, about 2 quarts of sauce total (you may need to add excess stock while cooking if your burner is cooking it too hot). A layer of fat may form on top during cooking, but do not skim it off. After cooking, remove bay leaves, add fish sauce and heavy cream and simmer until fat is emulsified, about five minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and allow to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Stir in parsley and basil. Bolognese will keep for up to 1 week in fridge, and will improve with time. Reheat until warm before using in lasagna.

While the ragù is simmering, make the ricotta mixture. Place ricotta in bowl of food processor or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment and process/mix until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add two eggs and minced herbs, and process/mix until incoroporated. Set aside at room temperature until ready to use.

Make the Besciamella: Heat butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, stirring occasionally, about 1 minute. Add flour and stir with whisk until light blond in color and slightly nutty aroma develops, about 1 minute. Add garlic, and stir to combine. Whisking constantly, add milk in steady stream until fully incorporated. Bring to a simmer (mixture should thicken). Remove heat, add cheese and nutmeg, and whisk until fully melted. Whisking constantly, return to a simmer, remove from heat, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready to use.

Adjust oven racks to lower middle and lowest positions and preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place lasagna noodles in 13- by 9-inch baking dish and cover with hot tap water (or boiled water) and allow to soak for 10 minutes, changing water once during soaking time. Drain in single layer on clean kitchen towels, or paper towels. Cover with second kitchen towel or paper towels and pat dry.

To Assemble: Add 1/6th of meat ragù (about 1 1/3 cups) to bottom of baking dish and drizzle with 1/2 cup besciamella. Place three noodles in single layer on top of sauce (noodles will not quite touch each other; this is okay). Top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/2 cup besciamella, 1/3 cup Parmigiano, and three more noodles. Spread 1/2 of ricotta mixture on top of noodles with rubber spatula, top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/3 cup parmigiano, and three more noodles. Top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/2 cup besciamella, 1/3 cup Parmigiano, and three more noodles. Spread remaining 1/2 of ricotta mixture on top of noodles with rubber spatula, top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/3 cup parmigiano, and three more noodles. Cover with remaining 1/6 of meat sauce, remaining besciamella (about 1 cup), and remaining 2/3 cup parmigiano. Baking dish should be very full at this point.

Place foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on lower rack to catch drips, then place lasagna on upper rack and bake until edges are starting to crisp, and top is a bubbly, golden brown, about 45 minutes, rotating half way through baking.

4 ounces (110g) fresh or stale rustic crusty bread, cut into 1-inch cubes

Freshly ground black pepper

Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving (optional)","In a 6-quart stovetop pressure cooker set over medium-high heat or an electric multi-cooker (such as an Instant Pot) set to sauté mode, heat olive oil until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, leek, onion, squash, and garlic, season with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 20 minutes; lower heat if necessary to prevent browning.

Add dried beans along with enough cold water to reach the pressure cooker's maximum fill line; this will vary slightly by pressure cook model but should be about 2 1/2 quarts (2.3 liters), enough to cover the vegetables and beans by roughly 2 inches (5cm). Add thyme and/or sage. Season well with salt.

Seal cooker and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat, if using a stovetop model, or by switching to pressure-cooker mode on an electric multi-cooker. Cook at high pressure for 1 hour.

Rapidly release pressure on the cooker (how you do this will vary depending on the model; see manufacturer's instructions). Open lid, being careful to avoid the strong blast of steam. Check beans; they should be creamy throughout. If they're still firm, return cooker to high pressure and cook 10 to 15 minutes longer, then check again. (For this recipe, it's far better to overcook your beans than undercook them.)

Stir in kale, then either simmer uncovered for 20 minutes until tender or replace lid and return to high pressure for 15 minutes if you want the kale very well done before rapidly releasing and opening the cooker again.

Stir in bread and simmer until it melts into the soup and no firm or distinct pieces remain, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt to taste; discard thyme/sage sprigs. You can adjust the consistency of the ribollita by either adding more water (or vegetable stock) if it's too thick, or simmering it to reduce the liquid until it reaches your desired thickness level; this is entirely a matter of personal preference.

Divide ribollita between individual serving bowls. Drizzle with fresh olive oil and top with freshly ground black pepper and grated cheese, if desired. Serve.","Italian,Braised & Stewed Beans,Pressure Cooked Beans,Cannellini & Kidney Beans,Kale",https://www.seriouseats.com/pressure-cooker-ribollita

Fior di Latte Gelato Recipe,Stella Parks,Barbecue Cuisine,"9 1/4 ounces plain or very lightly toasted sugar (about 1 1/3 cups; 265g)

1 1/4 ounces cornstarch (about 1/4 cup; 35g)

1/2 plus 1/8 teaspoon (2.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

20 ounces best quality whole milk, preferably grass-fed, divided (about 2 1/2 cups; 565g)

8 ounces best quality heavy cream, preferably grass-fed (about 1 cup; 225g)","Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a 3-quart saucier. When no lumps of cornstarch remain, add exactly 14 ounces of the milk (about 1 2/3 cup; 396g) and whisk to combine. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly but not vigorously, until it begins to simmer. This will take about 6 minutes, if the process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute. This ensures the cornstarch is fully hydrated.

Immediately transfer mixture to a large bowl, then whisk in the remaining milk and cream. Bearing in mind that the gelato will taste substantially less sweet once frozen, season with an additional pinch of salt, if desired. Cover and refrigerate the gelato base until cold, thick, and no warmer than 40°F, about 3 hours (this process can be sped along with an ice bath if time is of the essence; in that case, a stainless steel bowl will help cool the base even faster).

Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s directions. Meanwhile, place a quart-sized container and flexible spatula in the freezer. When gelato looks fluffy and thick, shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape gelato into the chilled container. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the gelato, and freeze until thick enough to scoop, about 4 hours.

Gelato is typically served at about 16°F, while most American freezers run at 0°F; for the most authentic presentation, soften gelato to 16°F in the refrigerator before serving. In a squat container, like a yogurt tub or a square storage container, this will take about 45 minutes. The timing will vary substantially depending on the size, shape, and material of the container (such as a metal loaf pan or glass baking dish), so check on the gelato frequently to ensure it does not melt.","Ice Cream,Italian,Mother's Day,Father's Day,Summer Desserts",https://www.seriouseats.com/fior-di-latte-gelato

Flip chicken and brown lightly on second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a large plate and set aside.

Return skillet to heat without draining it and add sausage. Cook until well browned on first side, about 1 1/2 minutes, reducing heat if it starts smoking. Flip sausage and cook on second side until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes longer. Remove pan from heat, transfer sausage to a cutting board, and cut each link into 3 to 4 slices.

Return pan to heat, add onion and bell pepper, and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon, until softened and starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Add sage and garlic, stir to combine, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add pickled cherry peppers and their liquid, stirring and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Add wine and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add chicken stock and sugar and stir to combine. Return sausage to pan, toss to combine, then return chicken pieces to pan skin side up, nestling them down among sauce, vegetables, and sausage.

Transfer to oven and cook until chicken is crisp and tender, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately, spooning sauce, vegetables, and sausage around chicken pieces.","Chicken Mains,Italian,Braised & Stewed Chicken,Chicken Thighs,Sausages",https://www.seriouseats.com/chicken-scarpariello-sweet-and-sour-chicken-italian-recipe
Stracciatella Gelato (Sweet Cream Chocolate Chip) Recipe,Stella Parks,Barbecue Cuisine,"9 1/4 ounces plain or very lightly toasted sugar (about 1 1/3 cups; 265g)

1 1/4 ounces cornstarch (about 1/4 cup; 35g)

1/2 plus 1/8 teaspoon (2.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

20 ounces best quality whole milk, preferably grass-fed, divided (about 2 1/2 cups; 565g)

8 ounces best quality heavy cream, preferably grass-fed (about 1 cup; 225g)

2 ounces best quality chocolate, between 60-75% cocoa solids, preferably single origin, see note (about 1/3 cup; 55g)

1/2 ounce refined coconut oil (about 1 heaping tablespoon; 15g)","Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a 3-quart saucier. When no lumps of cornstarch remain, add exactly 14 ounces of the milk (about 1 2/3 cup; 396g) and whisk to combine. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly but not vigorously, until it begins to simmer. This will take about 6 minutes, if the process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute. This ensures the cornstarch is fully hydrated.

Immediately transfer mixture to a large bowl, then whisk in the remaining milk and cream. Bearing in mind that the gelato will taste substantially less sweet once frozen, season with an additional pinch of salt, if desired. Cover and refrigerate the gelato base until cold, thick, and no warmer than 40°F, about 3 hours (this process can be sped along with an ice bath if time is of the essence; in that case, a stainless steel bowl will help cool the base even faster).

In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate with a few 15-second bursts at normal power, pausing to stir well between each addition. Add the coconut oil, and continue stirring until fully melted. For fine chips that partially homogenize into the gelato, cool to about 90°F before use. For larger, chunkier pieces that remain slightly more distinct, cool to about 70°F instead. For homogenous, custom pieces that do not dissolve into the gelato, pour the warm chocolate mixture onto a sheet of parchment with a plate or cutting board underneath, and spread to your desired thickness; freeze until solid and very cold, about 15 minutes, then crumple the parchment to break the chocolate into whatever size pieces you prefer.

Churn the gelato base in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s directions. Meanwhile, place a quart-sized container and flexible spatula in the freezer. When gelato looks fluffy and thick, add the cooled and melted chocolate, or the pre-made chocolate chips, and churn until well combined. Shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape gelato into the chilled container. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the gelato, and freeze until thick enough to scoop, about 4 hours.

Gelato is typically served at about 16°F, but most American freezers run at 0°F. For the most authentic presentation, soften gelato to 16°F in the refrigerator before serving. In a squat container, like a yogurt tub or a square storage container, this will take about 45 minutes. The timing will vary substantially depending on the size, shape, and material of the container (such as a metal loaf pan or glass baking dish), so check on the gelato frequently to ensure it does not melt.

The Best Slow-Cooked Bolognese Sauce Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Barbecue Cuisine,"1 quart (1L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock

1 to 1 1/2 ounces powdered gelatin (4 to 6 packets; 30 to 45g), such as Knox (see note)

1 (28-ounce; 800g) can peeled whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano

1/2 pound (225g) finely minced chicken livers

1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil

1 pound (450g) ground beef chuck (about 20% fat)

2 carrots, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)

4 ribs celery, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)

4 medium cloves garlic, minced

1/4 cup (about 25g) minced fresh sage leaves

1/2 cup (about 50g) minced fresh parsley leaves, divided

2 cups (475ml) dry white or red wine

1 cup (235ml) whole milk

2 bay leaves

1 cup (235ml) heavy cream

3 ounces (85g) finely grated Parmesan cheese

2 tablespoons (30ml) Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce, such as Red Boat

To Serve:

Dried or fresh pasta, preferably pappardelle, tagliatelle, or penne","Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place stock in a medium bowl or 1-quart liquid measure and sprinkle with gelatin. Set aside. Purée tomatoes in the can using an immersion blender or transfer to the bowl of a countertop blender and purée until smooth. Transfer chicken livers to a cup that just fits head of immersion blender and purée until smooth.

Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add ground beef, pork, and lamb; season with salt and pepper; and cook, stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon or potato masher, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in puréed chicken livers.

Meanwhile, heat butter and pancetta in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until fat has mostly rendered but butter and pancetta have not yet started to brown, about 8 minutes. Add onion, carrots, celery, garlic, sage, and half of parsley and cook, stirring and tossing, until vegetables are completely softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer mixture to Dutch oven with meat mixture.

Return Dutch oven to high heat and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated from the pan, about 10 minutes longer.

Add wine and cook, stirring, until mostly evaporated. Add reserved stock, tomatoes, milk, and bay leaves. Season gently with salt and pepper.

Bring sauce to a simmer, then transfer to oven, uncovered. Cook, stirring and scraping down sides of pot occasionally, until liquid has almost completely reduced and sauce is rich and thick underneath a heavy layer of fat, 3 to 4 hours. If sauce still looks liquid or fat has not separated and formed a thick layer after 4 hours, transfer to stovetop and finish cooking at a brisk simmer, stirring frequently.

Carefully skim off most of the fat, leaving behind about 1 cup total. (For more precise measurement, skim completely, then add back 1 cup of fat.)

Stir in heavy cream, Parmesan, fish sauce, and remaining parsley. Bring to a boil on stovetop, stirring constantly to emulsify. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bolognese can be cooled and stored in sealed containers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

To Serve: Heat sauce in a large pot until just simmering. Set aside. Cook pasta in a large pot of well-salted water until just barely al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot and add just enough sauce to coat, along with some of the cooking liquid. Cook over high heat, tossing and stirring gently, until sauce is thick and pasta is coated, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately, passing Parmesan at the table.","Italian,Braising & Stewing,Stovetop Pasta,Ground Beef,Ground Lamb",https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-slow-cooked-bolognese-sauce-recipe
Fresh Mozzarella From Scratch Recipe,Niki Achitoff-Gray,Barbecue Cuisine,"1 gallon (3.8L) nonhomogenized, low-temperature-pasteurized whole milk (see note)

1 1/2 teaspoons citric acid

1/4 teaspoon rennet or 1/4 tablet rennet, diluted in 2 tablespoons (30ml) filtered or distilled water

1 tablespoon (12g) kosher salt","Pour milk into a large stainless steel pot and whisk to disperse butterfat. Sprinkle citric acid into milk and stir well to fully dissolve.

Stirring every few minutes, bring the milk to 88°F (31°C) over medium-low heat (this should take about 5 minutes). Add rennet and stir to combine, about 30 seconds. Milk will begin to curdle into small clumps and separate from liquid whey. Reduce heat to low and continue heating until whey registers a temperature of 105°F (41°C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 to 10 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer curds to a strainer set over a bowl, pressing gently to drain. Curds should form a single mass. Allow to drain until whey is no longer dripping, about 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer drained curds to a cutting board. Slice into 1-inch cubes and divide into 3 even portions.

Meanwhile, season whey with 1 tablespoon (12g) kosher salt (or more to taste), stirring well to dissolve. Transfer 1/3 of whey to a heatproof bowl and set aside.

If Using the Stovetop Method: Bring remaining 2/3 of whey to 180°F (82°C) over high heat. Working with one portion of curds at a time, place in a heatproof bowl and add enough hot whey to cover. Wait 15 to 20 seconds, until curd is soft, sticky, and clumping together.

If Using a Microwave: Working with one portion of curds at a time, place in a microwave-safe dish and heat on high in 15-second intervals until curd is soft and sticky.

For Both Methods: Put on clean rubber gloves. Pick up ball of curds and slowly draw hands apart, allowing gravity to stretch curds; avoid forcing, tearing, or kneading curds. Continue folding and stretching curds, reheating in microwave or whey as necessary, until curds are shiny and smooth (this should take approximately 2 to 6 stretches).

Fold curd into a mass that's roughly the size of your palm and make a C shape with the forefinger and thumb of one hand. Push curd through those fingers, exerting pressure to shape it into a sphere. Press hard enough to prevent large bubbles from forming under the skin. Alternatively, make a closed loop with thumb and forefinger and make several small, egg-shaped bocconcini.

Gently lower ball(s) into room-temperature whey and let rest 20 to 30 minutes before eating. Meanwhile, repeat with remaining portions of curd. Cheese should be eaten immediately or within a few hours; to store, wrap tightly in plastic and follow these reheating guidelines.","Mozzarella,Italian,Summer Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-fresh-mozzarella-from-scratch-recipe

Osso Buco (Italian Braised Veal Shanks) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,Barbecue Cuisine,"6 (1- to 1 1/2-inch-thick) pieces osso buco (veal shanks) (about 4 pounds; 1.8kg total)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 cup all-purpose flour (5 ounces; 140g)

1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed

1 tablespoon unsalted butter (1/2 ounce; 15g)

1 large yellow onion, minced (12 ounces; 340g)

2 medium carrots, minced (6 ounces; 170g)

1 celery rib, minced (4 ounces; 120g)

3 medium cloves garlic, minced

1 cup (235ml) dry white wine

3/4 cup (175ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock

1 (28-ounce; 800g) can peeled whole tomatoes, seeded and drained, tomato flesh crushed by hand

3 fresh thyme sprigs

1 bay leaf

For the Gremolada:

2 tablespoons (about 20g) finely minced flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems

Zest of 1 lemon, finely minced

6 medium cloves garlic, finely minced","Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Season veal shanks all over with salt and pepper. If you have butcher's twine, you can tie a length of it tightly around the circumference of each shank; this can help them hold their shape during cooking, but is not absolutely necessary.

Add flour to a shallow bowl. In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, lightly dredge shanks all over in flour, shaking off excess, and add to Dutch oven; be careful not to over-crown the shanks. Cook shanks, turning occasionally, until lightly browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side; lower heat as necessary at any point to prevent scorching. Transfer browned shanks to a platter and repeat with remaining shanks; add more oil to Dutch oven at any point if it becomes too dry.

Add butter to Dutch oven, along with onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring, over medium-high heat until vegetables are softened and just starting to turn a light golden color, about 6 minutes.

Add wine, stock, and tomatoes to Dutch oven, along with veal shanks and any accumulated juices. Try to arrange the shanks in as even a layer as possible (a little overlap is okay to make them fit). The liquid should nearly but not totally cover the shanks; if it doesn't, add more stock or water until it does. Add thyme and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer.

Prepare a parchment paper lid following these instructions Cover shanks with parchment lid and transfer to oven. Cook for 2 hours.

Meanwhile, for the Gremolada: In a small bowl, stir together parsley, lemon zest, and garlic. Set aside.

Remove parchment paper lid from shanks and continue cooking until they are fork-tender, about 1 hour longer. If the pot becomes too dry, add more stock or water as needed to keep it moist; evaporation and reduction are good, but the pot shouldn't go dry. Feel free to move the shanks around so that any that are submerged can be exposed to the oven air. During the last 20 minutes of cooking, stir in 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10ml) gremolada, depending on how strong you want the lemon and garlic flavor to be.

Carefully transfer shanks to a platter. (Using a spatula and tongs together can help prevent them from falling apart.) Using a spoon, carefully scrape off any excess fat on surface of braising juices. The liquid should be saucy and thick; you can adjust the consistency by adding either water or stock to thin the sauce, or simmering it on the stovetop until more fully reduced. Discard thyme and bay leaf and season with salt and pepper if necessary.

Remove twine from shanks, if used. Serve shanks on plates, spooning braising sauce on top and passing remaining gremolada at the table for diners to sprinkle as a garnish to their own taste; make sure to offer small spoons for scooping out marrow from bones.

1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano (about 1 ounce; 25g), plus more for serving

1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1 ounce; 25g), plus more for serving

One-Bowl Homemade Ladyfingers Recipe,Stella Parks,Barbecue Cuisine,"3 large eggs (about 5 1/2 ounces; 155g)

4 3/4 ounces sugar (about 2/3 cup; 135g)

1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

1/4 ounce freshly grated lemon zest (about 1 tablespoon; 7g) from 1 large lemon, optional

4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)

1/2 ounce cornstarch (about 2 tablespoons; 15g)

Powdered sugar, for dusting","Getting Ready: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line two half sheet pans with parchment and fit a large piping bag with a 1/2-inch round tip. Roll bag open and stand upright in a tall drinking glass so it can be filled hands-free (full piping bag tutorial here). Have ready a small, fine-mesh sieve of powdered sugar for dusting. Fill a 2- or 3-quart saucier with a few inches of water; bring to a boil, then lower heat and adjust to maintain a steady supply of steam.

For the Ladyfingers: Combine eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer, using a flexible spatula to stir. Place over the steaming pot (if it touches the bottom, crumple a strip of foil into a ring to act as a booster seat) and cook, stirring and scraping constantly, until warmed to 160°F. This should not take significantly longer than 5 minutes; major delays simply indicate insufficient heat/lack of steam.

Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until the eggs are foamy, more than quadrupled in size, and thick enough to briefly mound up like soft serve when dropped from the whisk, from 5 to 10 minutes depending on the horsepower of your mixer. This is a crucial stage; if the foam is unable to hold soft peaks, the lady fingers will spread flat in the oven.

When eggs are foamy and thick enough to briefly hold their shape when dropped from the whisk, add lemon zest, if using, then sift the flour and cornstarch on top. Fold gently with a flexible spatula to combine in a thick batter. Transfer to prepared piping bag, twist to close, and pipe approximately thirty 3- by 1-inch fingers, leaving an inch between each one. When piping, hold the bag at a 45° angle and apply steady pressure as you pipe, then stop squeezing before you reach the end of each one, and lift the bag straight up to break the ""tail"" of batter.

Generously dust one tray with powdered sugar, and bake until puffed and firm to the touch, about 12 minutes. Set aside, then dust and bake the second tray as before. Cool ladyfingers to room temperature directly on the sheet pan, then transfer to an airtight container as soon as possible (if allowed to sit out after they have cooled, they will begin softening in the air). Use immediately, or store up to 3 weeks at room temperature.

.3 ounces (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) kosher salt, plus extra for assembly

.2 ounces (about 1 teaspoon) instant yeast, such as SAF Instant Yeast

.2 ounces (about 2 teaspoons) sugar

12 ounces water

1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled Italian tomatoes

12 ounces buffalo mozzarella or fresh cow's milk mozzarella

6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

24 basil leaves","Combine flour, salt, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Whisk to combine. Add water and knead on low speed just until mixture comes together and no dry flour remains. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Knead on low speed for an additional ten minutes. The mixture should come together into a cohesive mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. Depending on the type of flour used, you may need to add up to 1/2 cup additional flour. If dough sticks heavily to bottom of bowl, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time with mixer running until it forms a mass that just barely sticks to the bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the dough to two gallon-sized zipper lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 72 hours.

Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and dust the top with additional flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into six even pieces, approximately six ounces each. Using floured hands, shape each piece into a neat ball by gathering the dough towards the bottom. Coat four small containers with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil (large cereal bowls work great for this) and add one dough ball to each bowl. Lightly spray top of dough ball with non-stick cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours (dough should roughly double in volume).

Meanwhile, drain tomatoes in fine meshed strainer and break them up with your fingers, squeezing excess juice out from the interior. Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Cut the mozzarella into 1/2-inch chunks and place on a plate on a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place another triple layer of paper towels or clean dish towel on top of the cheese and stack another plate on top. Allow the excess water to blot out for at least 10 minutes.

Transfer 1 ball of dough to a medium bowl filled with flour and flip to coat. Lift it and gently pat off the excess flour. Transfer it to a floured surface and gently stretch it into a 10-inch circle, leaving the outer 1-inch edge slightly thicker than the center. The best way to do this it to start by gently stretching with your fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place it on the opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth between your opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss until it stretches out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return it to the work surface. With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in diameter.

Have your tomato sauce, drained cheese, pizza dough, olive oil, kosher salt, and basil leaves ready and close to the stovetop. Preheat the broiler to high and arrange the rack such that you can just barely fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat the skillet over high heat and heat until lightly smoking, about three minutes. Transfer one dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread two tablespoons sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and scatter four basil leaves over the surface. Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and darkly charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler). Return the skillet to the stovetop and cook until the bottom is darkly charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may skip this step if the pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to bake remaining pizzas.","Mains By Type,Italian",https://www.seriouseats.com/hacker-free-neapolitan-pizza-for-a-home-kitchen-recipe

10 grams Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.4 ounce; 2 1/2 teaspoons); for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

4 grams instant dry yeast, such as SAF (0.1 ounce; 1/2 packet or 1 rounded teaspoon)

400 grams room temperature water (14.1 ounces; 1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons)

68 grams extra-virgin olive oil (2.4 ounces; 5 tablespoons), divided

Coarse sea salt, such as Maldon or fleur de sel","For the Dough: Combine flour, salt, and yeast in large bowl and whisk together until homogenous. Add water and stir with wooden spoon until no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. Add 20 grams (0.7 ounces; 1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil and stir to incorporate, using hands if necessary to work oil into dough. Cover with plastic wrap, then let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.

Remove plastic wrap (but don't discard), and, using a lightly greased bowl scraper, fold dough over itself by lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 45 degrees and fold dough again; repeat turning and folding motion 4 more times (total of 6 folds). Cover tightly with reserved plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.

Repeat this entire folding process once more. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 18 hours or up to 3 days.

Baking the Focaccia: Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour, then transfer it to a lightly-floured work surface. Shape it by holding it with well-floured hands and tucking the dough underneath itself, rotating it until it forms a tight ball.

Pour 27 grams (1 ounce; 2 tablespoons) olive oil into 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet and spread over entire inner surface (including rim) with your hands. Transfer dough to pan, turn to coat in oil, position seam-side-down, and spread gently with your hands to mostly fill the pan (don't worry if dough doesn't fully stretch to edges). Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough is very soft and puffy and nearly doubled in volume, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position. Place baking stone or Baking Steel on it, and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Using your fingertips, gently press and stretch dough to evenly fill all corners of the pan. Lift up one edge of the dough to let air bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around the dough until there are no large air bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread around the pan. Using fingertips, gently press on surface of dough to create small dimples. Drizzle remaining 20 grams (0.7 ounces; 1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil over top of dough, then sprinkle with coarse sea salt.

Transfer skillet to oven, positioning it on top of baking stone, and bake, rotating pan halfway through baking, until top is golden brown and bottom is golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 25 to 30 minutes. Let focaccia cool in skillet for 5 minutes, then use a thin spatula to transfer focaccia to wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Spoon or brush any olive oil left in the skillet over the focaccia, and let cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing.

1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

2 cloves garlic, finely minced

1 small shallot, finely minced

1 teaspoon (5ml) Calabrian hot chili spread (see note)

1/2 cup (125ml) dry sake or dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio

Freshly ground black pepper

Small handful finely minced fresh chives, for serving","Set aside 4 tongues of sea urchin to use as garnish. Combine remaining sea urchin and crema using a blender, immersion blender, food processor, or mini chopper. Blend until completely smooth. Set aside.

Place pasta in a 12-inch skillet or a saucepan and cover with water. Season with salt. Set over high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until pasta is just shy of al dente and retains a small chalky core.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and shallot and cook, stirring constantly, until softened but not browned (lower heat if the aromatics threaten to brown), about 2 minutes. Add Calabrian chili spread and stir until homogeneous. Add sake or wine and cook until liquid is reduced down to less than 2 tablespoons, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and set aside until pasta is cooked.

When pasta is cooked, use tongs to transfer the noodles directly from the boiling water to the pan with the garlic/oil mixture. Scrape uni purée into pan and add a few ounces of starchy pasta-cooking water. Set pan over high heat and cook, stirring and swirling constantly, until the sauce comes together and develops a creamy consistency and the pasta is fully cooked, about 1 minute. Add more pasta water as necessary to thin the sauce if it over-thickens. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

Divide pasta between warmed serving bowls, drizzle each portion with more extra-virgin olive oil, garnish each with a whole sea urchin tongue, sprinkle with minced chives, and serve.

Freshly ground black pepper","In a medium skillet, combine 4 tablespoons (60ml) oil, garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.) Add capers and olives and stir to combine.

Add tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. If using, stir in canned tuna, flaking it gently with a fork. Remove from heat.

Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce. Alternatively, drain pasta through a colander, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water. Add drained pasta to sauce.

Add a few tablespoons of pasta water to sauce and set over medium-high heat to bring pasta and sauce to a vigorous simmer. Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more pasta water as necessary to keep sauce loose, until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. (The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did in the water.) Remove from heat and stir in remaining olive oil, parsley, and cheese.

Fresh Pasta Recipe,Niki Achitoff-Gray,Barbecue Cuisine,"9 ounces (255g; about 2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

2 whole large eggs (110g; about 4 ounces)

4 yolks from 4 large eggs (70g; about 2.5 ounces)

1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for salting water","To Make the Dough: On a large, clean work surface, pour flour in a mound. Make a well in the center about 4 inches wide. Pour whole eggs, egg yolks, and salt into well and, using a fork, beat thoroughly. When combined, gradually incorporate flour into the eggs until a wet, sticky dough has formed.

Using a bench knife, scrape excess dough from fork and fingers. Begin to fold additional flour into the dough with the bench knife, turning the dough roughly 45 degrees each time, until dough feels firm and dry, and can form a craggy-looking ball, 2 to 5 minutes.

Press the heel of your hand into the ball of dough, pushing forward and down. Rotate the ball 45 degrees and repeat. Continue until dough develops a smooth, elastic texture similar to a firm ball of Play-Doh. If dough feels too wet, add flour in 1 teaspoon increments. If dough feels too dry, add water slowly using a spray bottle.

Wrap ball of dough tightly in plastic wrap and rest on countertop for 30 minutes.

To Roll the Pasta: Meanwhile, place a sheet of parchment paper on a tray or cutting board and dust lightly with flour. Unwrap rested dough and cut into quarters. Set one quarter on work surface and re-wrap remaining dough. With a rolling pin, flatten the quarter of dough into an oblong shape about 1/2 inch thick.

Set pasta maker to widest setting and pass dough 3 times through the machine at this setting.

Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Fold both ends in so that they meet at the center of the dough, and then fold the dough in half where the end points meet, trying not to incorporate too much air into the folds. Using rolling pin, flatten dough to 1/2-inch thick. Pass through the rollers 3 additional times.

Narrow the setting by 1 notch and repeat Step 7. Repeat once more (the dough should now have passed through the third widest setting). Continue passing the dough through the rollers, reducing the thickness by 1 setting each time until it reaches the desired thickness. It should now be very delicate and elastic to the touch, and slightly translucent.

Place rolled dough onto a work surface or baking sheet lightly dusted with flour or lined with parchment paper, folding the dough over as necessary so that it fits; sprinkle with flour or line with parchment between folds to prevent sticking.

Cover dough with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel to prevent drying, then repeat Steps 5 through 9 with remaining dough quarters. If making noodles, cut dough into 12- to 14-inch segments.

To Cut Noodles: Adjust pasta machine to noodle setting of your choice. Working one dough segment at a time, feed dough through the pasta-cutter. Alternatively, cut folded dough by hand with a chef's knife to desired noodle width.

Divide the cut noodles into individual portions, dust lightly with flour, and curl into a nest. Place on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and gently cover with kitchen towel until ready to cook. Pasta can be frozen directly on the baking sheet, transferred to a zipper-lock freezer bag, and stored in the freezer for up to three weeks before cooking. Cook frozen pasta directly from the freezer.

To Cook: Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add pasta, stir gently with a wooden spoon, chopsticks, or a cooking fork, and cook, tasting at regular intervals until noodles are just set with a definite bite, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Drain, toss with sauce, and serve.","Pastas,Italian,Pasta Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/fresh-egg-pasta

3 tablespoons whole fennel seed

1 tablespoon crushed red pepper

3 tablespoons finely chopped rosemary, sage, or thyme leaves

12 cloves garlic, grated on a microplane grater

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons baking powder","Place pork belly skin-side down on a large cutting board. Using a sharp chef's knife, score flesh at an angle using strokes about 1-inch apart. Rotate knife 90 degrees and repeat to create a diamond pattern in the flesh.

Toast peppercorns and fennel seed in a small skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned and aromatic, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind until roughly crushed.

Season pork liberally with salt then sprinkle with crushed pepper and fennel, red pepper, chopped herbs, and microplaned garlic. Use your hands to rub the mixture deeply into the cracks and crevices in the meat.

Roll belly into a tight log and push to top of cutting board, seam-side down. Cut 12 to 18 lengths of kitchen twine long enough to tie around the pork and lay them down in regular intervals along your cutting board, about 1-inch apart each. Lay rolled pork seam-side down on top of strings. Working from the outermost strings towards the center, tie up roast tightly. Combine 2 tablespoons kosher salt with 1 teaspoon baking powder. Rub mixture over entire surface of porchetta.

If roast is too large and unwieldy, carefully slice in half with a sharp chef's knife. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate at least overnight and up to three days. If desired, porchetta can also be frozen at this point for future use (see note)

Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F. Place pork in a v-rack set in a large roasting pan, or if cooking both halves at the same time, on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Place roasting pan in oven and roast until internal temperature of pork reaches 160°F, about two hours, basting with pan drippings every half hour. If you'd like to cook potatoes along with the porchetta, see note. Continue roasting until a knife or skewer inserted into the pork shows very little resistance asides from the outer layer of skin, about two hours longer.

Increase oven temperature to 500°F and continue roasting until completely crisp and blistered, about 20 to 30 minutes longer. Alternatively, you can remove the roast from the oven and tent with foil for up to two hours before finishing it in a preheated 500°F oven.

Tent with foil and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife into 1-inch thick disks and serve.","Pork Belly,Easter,Italian,Roasted Pork,Pork Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/all-belly-porchetta-recipe-italian-roast-pork

5 sprigs thyme

10 whole black peppercorns

3 medium cloves garlic, crushed

3 tablespoons (45ml) refined neutral coconut oil (see note)

3 tablespoons (25g) all-purpose flour

Generous pinch freshly grated nutmeg

For the Lasagna:

1 pound (450g) dry lasagna noodles (egg-free), cooked about 2 minutes less than package instructions indicate, then drained and chilled in ice water

5 cups (1.2L) Quick Italian-American Red Sauce (made without the butter) or Vegan Bolognese Sauce","For the Vegan ""Ricotta"": Cut tofu into 1 inch thick slabs. Set tofu on paper towels, lay more paper towels on top and press to extract any excess moisture. Set aside.

In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, combine almond milk and oregano. Add cauliflower, cover, and bring almond milk to a boil over high heat. Continue to cook, covered, until cauliflower is fully tender, about 10 minutes; adjust heat as necessary to maintain boil while preventing scorching.

Add coconut oil, basil, and garlic. Using an immersion blender, purée cauliflower until very smooth. Add tofu and purée into cauliflower until well incorporated; the resulting purée should have a slightly grainy, ricotta-like texture thanks to the tofu. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

For the Béchamel: In a small saucepan, combine almond milk with bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic. Bring to a bare simmer, then lower heat to maintain a bare simmer for 20 minutes. Strain almond milk into a heatproof measuring cup and discard aromatics.

In a small saucepan, heat coconut oil over medium heat until melted. Add flour and cook, whisking, until raw flour smell is gone, about 2 minutes.

Whisking constantly, add infused almond milk in a thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pan to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.

Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until béchamel sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. Stir in nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.

For the Lasagna: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Drain pasta well. In a 9- by 13-inch baking dish, lay down a single layer of lasagna sheets to cover the bottom of the dish. Spread an even layer of vegan ""ricotta"" top, then spread a layer of tomato sauce (or vegan ragù, if using) on top of that. Drizzle with some of the béchamel. Repeat in alternating layers of pasta, ""ricotta,"" tomato sauce (or ragù), and béchamel sauce until baking dish is full and/or any of the components is used up. The final layer should be tomato sauce (or ragù) with béchamel drizzled on top. You may have some of the vegan ""ricotta"" left over, which can be reserved for another use (such as spreading on toasts).

Classic Chicken and Wild Rice Hotdish From 'The New Midwestern Table',Kate Williams,Barbecue Cuisine,"1/2 cup natural wild rice

Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 dried bay leaf

6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) salted butter, plus more, at room temperature, for the baking dish

2 leeks, white and green parts, cut into small dice (2 1/2 cups)

3 stalks celery, cut into small dice

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 1/2 cups whole milk

2/3 cup heavy cream

3/4 cup chicken stock, low-sodium store-bought or homemade

3/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, or 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh

1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg

2 cups roughly chopped cooked chicken meat

4 ounces aged Gouda or aged cheddar cheese, grated (1 1/2 cups)

2 cups coarsely ground buttery crackers, such as Ritz or Club (about 2 sleeves)

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","Put the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse it under cold running water, swishing the rice with your hand until the water runs clear. Transfer the rice to a medium bowl, and add water to cover. Pour off any black bits or floating kernels, pour the rice back into the sieve to drain, and then put it in a small saucepan. Add 1 1/4 cups water, a pinch of salt, and the bay leaf, and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to low. Steam for 25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water has evaporated.


(If liquid remains after the rice is done, drain it in a sieve.)

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375°F.

While the rice cooks, heat the butter in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and celery, and season with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes.

Add the flour to the vegetables and stir until well combined with the butter. Pour in the milk and bring to a simmer, whisking to prevent any lumps. Add the cream, chicken stock, thyme, nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Simmer over low heat until the floury taste dissipates, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked chicken, wild rice (minus the bay leaf), and half of the cheese, and heat until the cheese melts.

Put the crushed crackers in a heavy plastic bag and add 1/4 teaspoon pepper and the olive oil. Shake to combine, and set aside.

Rub a 9 × 13-inch baking dish with a thin layer of soft butter. Pour the hotdish mixture into the dish and top with the remaining cheese. Bake for 25 minutes.

Pull the dish from the oven, sprinkle the cracker mixture evenly over the top, and bake until the crackers turn dark golden brown and the hotdish bubbles in the center, about 25 minutes. Serve immediately.

Notes: If you have leftover gravy on hand, by all means use it in place of the chicken stock in this recipe.


You can use a supermarket rotisserie chicken for the cooked chicken, but in that case, reduce the salt by 1/4 teaspoon.


If you have cooked wild rice on hand, use 2 cups for this recipe.","Chicken Mains,Midwestern,Savory,Wild Rice",https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-chicken-and-wild-rice-hotdish-from-th
Classic Beef Pot Roast with Pistachio Salt from 'The New Midwestern Table',Kate Williams,Barbecue Cuisine,"1 (4-pound) beef chuck roast, the more marbled the better

Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon canola oil

2 tablespoons salted butter

3 stalks celery, cut into thirds

3 large carrots, quartered

2 medium turnips, quartered

3/4 cup dry red wine

2 cups beef stock, low-sodium store-bought or homemade

2 large Vidalia onions, cut into eighths

11 cloves garlic: 10 whole, 1 minced

4 dried bay leaves

1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

1 cup cherry tomatoes

1/4 cup shelled salted pistachios, chopped

1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley","Season the roast liberally with salt and pepper. Heat your largest high-sided skillet over high heat, add the oil, and then add the roast. Sear it quickly until dark brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Set the roast aside, pour off and discard the excess fat from the skillet, and let the skillet cool a bit. Then add the butter, celery, carrots, turnips, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook over medium heat, tossing, until the vegetables begin to soften at the edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer them to a wide bowl and reserve.

Preheat the oven to 300°F.

Add the wine to the skillet, bring to a boil, and cook until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Add the beef stock, and bring to a simmer.

Arrange the onions in the bottom of a large covered roasting pan and set the beef on top of them. Scatter the whole garlic cloves, bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme over and around the roast. Pour the beef stock mixture over the meat and cover the pan tightly. Braise for 1 hour.

Reduce the oven temperature to 285°F, and continue to braise for 2 hours.

Uncover the pan, skim off the fat around the edges with a small ladle, and discard it. With two large forks, carefully turn the meat over and ladle some juice over the top. Add the reserved sautéed vegetables, arranging them around the perimeter of the meat. Cover the pan and braise for 1 more hour.

Skim the fat again with a small ladle, baste the top of the meat again, and then scatter the cherry tomatoes across the top, some dropping onto the meat, some onto the vegetables. Don’t stir again. Braise, uncovered this time to allow the tomatoes to split and shrink and the top of the meat to brown, until the meat feels extremely tender at the touch of a fork, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Discard the bay leaves.

For the pistachio salt, combine the pistachios, parsley, minced garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a small bowl.

Before serving, dust the pistachio salt evenly over the roast (reserve any extra for passing at the table). Serve the pot roast right from the pan, pulling apart the meat with two forks for most of it, and gently carving the marbled top end of the chuck into thick slices.","Beef Mains,Midwestern,Braised & Stewed Beef",https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-beef-pot-roast-with-pistachio-salt-from-the-new-midwestern-table
Homemade Chicken Nuggets With Sweet 'n' Sour Sauce Recipe,Tim Chin,Barbecue Cuisine,"For the Nuggets:

1 pound (450g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces

1/2 teaspoon (3ml) soy sauce

1/2 teaspoon (3g) yellow mustard

1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

1/8 teaspoon finely ground white pepper

To Coat and Fry:

1/2 cup (2.5 ounces; 70g) all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons (16g) cornstarch

1 teaspoon (3g) chicken-flavored broth powder, such as Orrington Farms

1/2 teaspoon (1.5g) baking powder

1/2 teaspoon finely ground white pepper

3/4 cup (180ml) water

4 cups (950ml) vegetable oil, for frying","For the Nuggets: In a medium mixing bowl, using clean hands, mix chicken and salt until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours.

Lightly grease a baking sheet. Transfer chicken to bowl of food processor. Add broth powder, white pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder and process, scraping down sides with spatula as needed, until a smooth and uniform paste forms, about 1 minute. Using lightly wet hands, divide chicken into 1 tablespoon (15g) portions. Roll portions into balls and gently flatten between palms, forming 1/2-inch thick nugget shapes. Place formed nuggets on lightly greased baking sheet.

Meanwhile, For the Sauce: In a small saucepan, combine jam, corn syrup, 2 tablespoons (30ml) water, vinegar, cornstarch, broth powder, soy sauce, mustard, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and white pepper. Using an immersion blender, blend until throughly combined and smooth. Set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture boils and becomes clear, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer sauce to a heatproof bowl and let cool at room temperature. Set aside.

To Coat and Fry: In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk together flour, cornstarch, broth powder, baking powder, and white pepper, at least 30 seconds. Working 1 piece at a time, coat chicken nuggets in flour mixture, pressing gently to adhere, then shake off excess and return to baking sheet. Let dusted nuggets rest for 15 minutes; reserve flour mixture.

In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until it registers 350°F (175°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Add 3/4 cup (180ml) water to flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Add half of nuggets to batter and toss gently until submerged. Working in 2 batches, remove nuggets one at a time from batter, allowing any excess batter to drip back into bowl, and carefully add to hot oil. Cook nuggets, flipping every 30 seconds, until nuggets puff up and begin to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer nuggets to prepared wire rack. Return oil to 350°F and repeat with remaining nuggets. Let second batch of nuggets rest on wire rack for at least 5 minutes before moving to next step to let coating set.

Bring oil to 375°F (190°C). Carefully return all nuggets to oil and cook, flipping occasionally, until deep golden brown and very crispy, about 4 minutes.

Spaghetti With Canned-Clam Sauce Recipe,Sho Spaeth,Barbecue Cuisine,"4 tablespoons (60g) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and divided

2 celery ribs (5 oz; 140g), peeled (optional) and cut into small dice

2 medium shallots (60g), minced

1/2 cup (30g) finely chopped fresh parsley leaves, divided

4 medium garlic cloves (15g), finely minced

1 fresh green Thai chili (4g), thinly sliced (optional, see note)

Freshly ground black pepper

Two (8-ounce; 237ml) bottles clam juice

Two (6.5-ounce; 184g) cans chopped or minced clams, clams and liquid divided

1 lb (450g) spaghetti

1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce

Kosher salt

Celery leaves (pale yellow-green leaves from the celery heart), for garnish

Lemon wedges, for serving","In a 12-inch stainless steel skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat, and swirl pan until foaming subsides. Add celery, shallots, half the parsley (1/4 cup; 15g), garlic, Thai chili (if using), and a couple healthy grinds of black pepper to pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and mixture is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add bottled clam juice along with liquid from canned clams but not the clam meat. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer until liquid is slightly reduced and vegetables have infused broth, about 5 minutes—there should be enough liquid in the pan to fully submerge the pound of cooked pasta. Turn off heat and add clam meat and soy sauce.

In a pot of salted, boiling water, cook spaghetti, stirring frequently, until about 4 minutes shy of the way you like your pasta cooked (some would say ""al dente""). When spaghetti is almost at that point of doneness, bring pan of clam sauce to a boil over high heat.

Using tongs, transfer spaghetti to pan with clam sauce, distributing pasta so it is mostly submerged in sauce. Cook, tossing and stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked to your liking and sauce has thickened slightly, about 4 minutes. Taste for seasoning, and add salt if necessary.

Turn off heat, add remaining butter and parsley, and toss and stir spaghetti vigorously to incorporate parsley and emulsify butter into sauce. Divide pasta among four serving plates, spooning sauce and clams evenly over each portion. Garnish with celery leaves, and serve immediately, passing lemon wedges, for squeezing, at the table.","American,Spaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine,Seafood Mains,Pasta Mains,Quick Dinners",https://www.seriouseats.com/spaghetti-with-canned-clam-sauce
The Best Chicken Parmesan Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Barbecue Cuisine,"3 boneless skinless chicken breast halves

1 3/4 cups buttermilk, divided

2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1/2 loaf crusty italian bread, crust removed, sliced into 1/2-inch slices

5 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

2 large eggs

1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil

1 quart Italian-American red sauce (see note)

10 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch chunks

2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, basil, or a mix","With a sharp chef's knife, split chicken breasts in half horizontally. Working one piece at a time, place inside a plastic zipper-lock bag and pound with a meat pounder or the bottom of a skillet to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Transfer to a large bowl.

Add 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and minced garlic to bowl. Season with 2 tablespoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Turn chicken with hands until salt, pepper, and garlic are evenly incorporated and all the chicken is coated in buttermilk mixture. Transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out the air, and seal. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight (see note).

Meanwhile, place bread slices on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Leave out on counter for at least 4 hours and up to overnight until mostly dried.

The next day, break bread into rough pieces (leave the wire rack in the rimmed baking sheet) and combine with 4 ounces Parmesan cheese in the food processor. Season with black pepper. Process until bread is finely ground, about 20 seconds. Transfer mixture to a large shallow bowl or pie plate.

Place flour in a second shallow bowl or pie plate. Whisk eggs, 2 tablespoons buttermilk, and 1 tablespoon of the flour in a third pie plate. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk over the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture and incorporate with your fingertips. The mixture should be mealy, but hold together in clumps if you squeeze it together with your hands.

Working one piece of chicken at a time, remove from the bag and add to flour. Turn to coat, shake off excess, and add to egg mixture. Turn to coat, letting excess drip off, and add to breadcrumb mixture. Turn to coat, piling crumbs on top and pressing down firmly so a thick layer adheres. Transfer coated chicken to the wire rack and repeat with remaining chicken breasts.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Place sauce in a medium saucepan and heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until barely simmering. Remove from heat and set aside.

Heat oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until it registers 375 to 400°F on an instant read or deep-frying thermometer. Working in batches, carefully add chicken by lowering the cutlets away from you into the oil. Add as many cutlets as will fit in one layer (2 to 3).

Cook, swirling pan gently and using a thin flexible metal spatula to loosen chicken if it sticks, until chicken is golden-brown and crisp on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula and a fork, carefully flip chicken and cook until golden brown on second side. Transfer chicken to a paper-towel lined plate to drain and repeat with remaining chicken.

Spoon 1/3 of sauce onto the bottom of a casserole or oven-safe serving dish. Shingle chicken pieces on top of sauce. Top with more sauce, forming a line down the center. Combine mozzarella and remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese in a large bowl and toss to coat. Lay cheese mixture over chicken in a straight line down the center.

Transfer to the oven and cook until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately grate fresh Parmesan on top. Allow to rest for 3 minutes, top with chopped herbs, and serve immediately.","American,Chicken Cutlets,Tomato,Chicken Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chicken-parmesan-recipe

Flatten gently with your hand, then re-roll into an 8-inch disk.

Paint with another layer of sesame oil, sprinkle with 1/2 cup scallions, and roll up like a jelly roll again. Twist into a spiral, flatten gently, and re-roll into a 7-inch disk. Repeat steps two and three with remaining pancakes.

Combine all the sauce ingredients and set aside at room temperature.

Heat oil in an 8-inch nonstick or cast-iron over medium-high heat until shimmering and carefully slip pancake into the hot oil. Cook, shaking the pan gently until first side is an even golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip with a spatula or tongs (be careful not to splash the oil), and continue to cook, shaking pan gently, until second side is even golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt, cut into 6 wedges. Serve immediately with sauce for dipping.

Grilled Flatbread With Olive Oil and Za'atar Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Middle Eastern,"For the Flatbread (see note):

10 ounces (about 2 cups) bread flour

1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast

2 teaspoons sugar

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

6 1/2 ounces (about 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon) yogurt or whole milk

To Serve (see note if using store-bought za'atar):

1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano

2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves

2 tablespoons minced fresh savory

1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds

1 1/2 tablespoons ground sumac (see note)

2 tablespoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt

Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing and drizzling

3/4 cup labne (see note)","For the Flatbread: Combine flour, salt, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk until combined. Add olive oil and the yogurt or milk and knead with dough hook at low speed until dough comes together into a smooth ball. Dough should stick slightly to bottom of bowl as it kneads (add slightly more yogurt or milk as necessary). Continue to knead for 5 minutes. Alternatively, form dough in a food processor by adding all ingredients and processing until the dough rides around the blade. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature until roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Using a bench scraper or a knife, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then place on a well-floured surface (leaving a few inches of space between each one) and cover with a floured cloth. Alternatively, place each ball of dough in an individual covered pint-size deli container. Allow dough to rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.

Working with one ball of dough at a time, stretch dough with floured hands or a rolling pin into an oblong or circle roughly 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. Once you have 2 or 3 pieces stretched, lay them out directly above the hot side of the grill. Cook without moving, popping any large air bubbles with a knife or the edge of a spatula or pizza peel, until bottom side is charred in spots and light golden brown. Flip with a large spatula, pizza peel, or tongs and cook until other side is charred and browned. Remove bread from the grill, transfer to a large plate, and cover with a clean dish towel to keep warm while you cook the remaining bread.

To Serve: Form the za'atar mixture by combining oregano, thyme, savory, sesame seeds, sumac, and salt in a small bowl and stirring with fingers until homogenous. Brush finished flatbreads with olive oil and sprinkle generously with the za'atar mixture. Place labne in a serving dish, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with za'atar.

1 cup sugar (7 ounces; 200g)

1 1/2 cups unsweetened apple juice (12 ounces; 340g)

2-inch piece ginger (2 ounces; 60g), unpeeled, cut in half lengthwise and smashed

Zest from 1 medium lemon

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (1/2 ounce; 14g), from about 1 lemon

4 tablespoons Applejack brandy (2 ounces; 60g)

For the Cake:

4 large eggs (6.8 ounces; 190g)

3/4 cup sugar (5 3/4 ounces; 160g)

1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same by weight

1 cup vegetable oil (8 ounces; 220g), or any other neutral oil

2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger (1 ounce; 30g)

2 1/2 cups almond flour (8 ounces; 230g)

1 1/2 cups finely chopped walnuts (6.2 ounces; 175g)

2 teaspoons (6g) ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

2 cups grated unpeeled Fuji apple (12 ounces; 340g), from about 2 medium apples","Getting Ready: Adjust rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a 9- by 13-inch anodized aluminum baking pan with parchment paper, covering bottom and long sides of pan. (It's all right to leave the short sides exposed.) Lightly grease pan with nonstick cooking spray.

For the Syrup: In a 2-quart nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat, simmer together sugar, apple juice, ginger, and lemon peel until syrup reaches 234°F (112°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Remove syrup from heat and add lemon juice and Applejack. Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.

For the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine eggs, sugar, and salt. Using a whisk attachment, whip on high until eggs become thick, pale, and ribbon-y, about 10 minutes. With mixer running on medium, slowly drizzle in oil in a thin stream until fully incorporated and thick. Whisk in grated ginger, about 10 seconds, then shut off mixer and remove bowl.

Using a flexible rubber spatula, fold in almond flour, walnuts, cinnamon, and nutmeg until combined. Fold in grated apple. Pour batter into prepared pan and gently tap on the counter to evenly distribute. Bake until golden brown and top of cake bounces back to the touch, about 50 minutes.

While cake is still warm, loosen exposed short sides of cake from pan using an offset spatula or butter knife. Using parchment paper as a handle, lift cake out of pan and onto a cutting board. Cut cake into diamond shapes by making a series of diagonal slices in one direction across the cake, then making another series of diagonal slices in the opposite direction. Lift sliced cake, again using parchment, and return to pan. Strain syrup over warm cake using a fine-mesh strainer, then let sit at least 1 hour to allow cake to fully absorb syrup. Serve.

Sini Manti (Armenian Baked Lamb Manti) Recipe,Andrew Janjigian,Middle Eastern,"For the Broth:

1 pound (450g) lamb shanks or lamb neck slices

1 1/2 teaspoons (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided; if using table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight

1 quart (960ml) homemade or store-bought low sodium chicken stock

5 medium garlic cloves, lightly crushed

1/4 cup (60g) tomato paste

For the Dough:

280 grams (about 10 ounces; 2 cups) all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon (135ml) water (add extra 1 teaspoon (5ml) if rolling dough by hand)

1 large egg yolk (15g)

For the Manti Filling:

1 small onion (about 6 ounces; 170g), peeled and quartered

3 medium garlic cloves

1 tablespoon (6g) fresh parsley leaves and tender stems

1 teaspoon paprika

1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper (or an additional 1 teaspoon paprika; see notes)

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

6 ounces (170g) ground lamb or 85% lean ground beef

2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil

For the Yogurt-Garlic Sauce:

2 medium garlic cloves, minced

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

2 cups (450g) Greek yogurt

For Serving:

2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper (or paprika or gochugaru; see notes)

2 teaspoons ground sumac","For the Broth: Sprinkle lamb evenly on all sides with 1 teaspoon salt and place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

Combine lamb, chicken stock, garlic, tomato paste, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a pressure cooker, and stir to combine. Seal pressure cooker, and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat, if using a stovetop model, or by setting to pressure-cooker mode on an electric multi-cooker. Cook at high pressure for 40 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure (if using a stovetop pressure cooker; electric ones will automatically regulate the heat and pressure level).

Depressurize cooker using the quick-release method, then carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you. Strain broth through fine-mesh strainer into clean heatproof container, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; add water as needed to yield a total 3 cups (700ml) broth. Season with additional salt to taste. Transfer lamb to cutting board and set broth aside to cool to room temperature. When broth has cooled, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. When lamb is cool enough to handle, separate meat from bones in large pieces; set meat aside and discard bones.

For the Dough: Place flour and salt in food processor bowl and pulse twice to combine. Add butter and process until fully incorporated, 10 to 20 seconds. Add water (adding extra 1 teaspoon (5ml) water if rolling dough by hand) and egg yolk and process until dough ball starts to form and mixture looks pebbly, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter; return food processor bowl to base, but don't clean it. Knead dough until uniform in texture (dough will remain slightly rough in texture), 15 to 30 seconds. Form dough into a 4-inch disk, wrap tightly in plastic, and set aside to rest on countertop for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours (or transfer to refrigerator for up to 24 hours).

For the Manti Filling: Meanwhile, in now-empty food processor, place onion, garlic, parsley, paprika, allspice, Aleppo pepper, salt, and pepper and process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, about 15 seconds. Break up ground lamb into small pieces, add to food processor, and pulse to combine, 8 to 10 one-second pulses (do not over-process, as this will make the filling chewy and bouncy rather than tender). Transfer filling to an airtight container and refrigerate until needed (mixture may be made up to 24 hours in advance).

To Roll the Dough and Bake Manti: Set oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Using a pastry brush, coat 2 rimmed baking sheets with 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil each and set aside.

Dust countertop lightly with flour. Unwrap rested dough and cut into quarters. Set one quarter on work surface and re-wrap remaining dough. Using rolling pin and fingers, flatten and stretch dough to 5- by 4-inch oval that is 1/4 inch thick. If using pasta roller, proceed to step 8. If rolling dough by hand, roll dough into 12- x 8 1/16-inch rectangle using a rolling pin. Cut dough in half lengthwise to yield two 12- x 4-inch sheets. Cut each strip into seven 1 3/4-inch-wide strips. Divide each strip in half crosswise into two 1 1/4-inch squares; each sheet of dough should yield at least 28 squares. Proceed to step 13.

Set pasta roller to widest setting and pass dough 3 times through the machine lengthwise at this setting.

Place dough on lightly floured work surface. Fold both ends in so that they meet at the center of the dough, and then fold the dough in half where the end points meet, trying not to incorporate too much air into the folds. Using rolling pin and fingers, flatten and stretch dough to 6- by 3-inch rectangle that is 1/4 inch thick. Pass through the rollers lengthwise 3 additional times.

Narrow the setting by 1 notch and pass dough 3 times through the machine at this setting.

Narrow the setting by 1 notch and pass dough twice through the machine at this setting. Continue passing the dough through the rollers, reducing the thickness by 1 setting each time until it measures about 24 x 3 x 1/16 inches (setting 5 on a Marcato Atlas pasta roller). It should now be very delicate and elastic to the touch, and slightly translucent.

Transfer rolled dough to lightly floured work surface, and lightly coat both sides of dough with flour to prevent sticking. Using pastry wheel, pizza cutter, or sharp knife, cut sheet crosswise into fourteen 1 3/4-inch-wide strips. Divide each strip in half crosswise into two 1 1/2- by 1 3/4-inch strips; each sheet of dough should yield at least 28 strips.

Using 1/8 teaspoon measuring spoon, place scant 1/4 teaspoon ball of meat filling in center of each strip of dough.

Working one at a time, using lightly floured hands and fingertips, lift strip of dough in hands and fold in half loosely over filling lengthwise. Pinch sides of dough together, working your way toward filling to enclose it (do not seal dough across top and do not push ball of filling up and out of dumpling). Place manti on lightly floured counter and then gently pinch ends between fingers to form flat-bottomed, stable canoe shape. Transfer to prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining strips of dough. Using fingertips, gently press meat filling into manti to make them flush with top of dough.

Repeat steps 7 through 14 with another quarter of dough (if rolling by hand, repeat steps 7, 13, and 14).

Place baking sheet of manti in oven and bake until lightly and evenly golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and allow to cool to room temperature.

While first tray of manti bakes, repeat steps 7 through 14 with remaining 2 quarters of dough, followed by step 16 to bake and cool remaining manti (cooled manti can be transferred to zipper lock freezer bags and frozen for up to 3 weeks). Once all manti are baked, adjust oven racks so that one is in upper-middle position, the other is in lower-middle position, and lower oven temperature to 325°F (165°C).

For the Yogurt-Garlic Sauce: Using a fork, mash garlic and salt to a rough paste on cutting board. Combine yogurt and garlic mixture in small bowl and whisk until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

To Finish and Serve Manti: In large saucepan, bring broth to boil over high heat. Add reserved lamb pieces, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover.

Return both baking sheets of manti to oven and bake until manti are golden brown and heated through, 15 to 20 minutes (20 to 25 if starting with frozen manti).

Add about 1/2 cup (120ml) hot broth to individual serving bowls. Place 15 to 20 manti in broth and top with 3 to 4 tablespoons yogurt-garlic sauce. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of Aleppo pepper and sumac each. Serve immediately.

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

About 3 tablespoons yellow mustard

24-ounces freshly ground beef (see note), divided into twelve 2-ounce pucks

1 large onion, sliced paper thin on a mandoline (about 1 1/2 cups total)

6 slices American cheese, cut in half

12 Slider Rolls (preferably Martin's brand Sliced Sandwich Rolls)","Combine mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, sugar, white vinegar, pickles, and pickle juice in a food processor. Process until almost smooth. Season to taste with plenty of black pepper and a little salt (depending on how salty your pickles were, you may not need any extra salt). Set spread aside.

Heat an electric griddle to 400°F. Squirt twelve dots of mustard of about 3/4-teaspoons each in an evenly spaced grid over the surface of the griddle, leaving about 3-inches between each dot. Place one ball of meat on top of each dollop. Season generously with salt and pepper, then smash down with a stiff spatula into patties approximately 1/4-inch thick and 3-inches wide. Spread onions evenly over surface of burger patties and press down with spatula. Allow to cook for 1 minute on first side.

Flip patties so that onions are underneath (patties will not necessarily be colored—this is ok; the flavor in sliders comes from steam, not from browning). Top each patty with a half slice of American cheese. Place top buns cut-side-down on top of patties and top with bottom buns, also cut-side-down. Drape a towel over the whole griddle to trap steam.

Couscous and Mograbiah With Oven-Dried Tomatoes From 'Ottolenghi',Kate Williams,Middle Eastern,"16 large, ripe plum tomatoes, cut in half lengthwise

2 tablespoons muscovado sugar

2/3 cup (150 ml) olive oil

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

2 onions, thinly sliced

1 1/2 cups (250 g) mograbiah

1 2/3 cups (400 ml) chicken or vegetable stock

a pinch of saffron threads

1 1/2 cups (250 g) couscous

1 tablespoon tarragon leaves

1 tablespoon nigella seeds

3 1/2 ounces (100 g) Labneh

coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","Preheat the oven to 300°F / 150°C. Arrange the tomato halves, skin side down, on a baking sheet and sprinkle with the sugar, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, and some salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake for 2 hours, until the tomatoes have lost most of their moisture.

Meanwhile, put the onions in a large pan with 4 tablespoons of the olive oil and sauté over high heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are a dark golden color.

Throw the mograbiah into a large pan of boiling salted water (as for cooking pasta). Simmer for 15 minutes, until it is soft but still retains a bite; some varieties might take less time, so check the instructions on the packet. Drain well and rinse under cold water.

In a separate pot, bring the stock to a boil with the saffron and a little salt. Place the couscous in a large bowl and add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the boiling stock. Cover with plastic wrap and leave for 10 minutes.

Once ready, mix the couscous with a fork or a whisk to get rid of any lumps and to fluff it up. Add the cooked mograbiah, the tomatoes and their juices, the onions and their oil, the tarragon, and half the nigella seeds. Taste and adjust the seasoning and oil. It is likely that it will need a fair amount of salt. Allow the dish to come to room temperature. To serve, arrange it gently on a serving plate, place the labneh on top (in balls or spoonfuls), drizzle with the remaining oil, and finish with the rest of the nigella seeds.","Grain Salads,Middle Eastern,Vegetarian,Couscous,Tomato",https://www.seriouseats.com/couscous-and-mograbiah-with-oven-dried-tomatoes-from-ottolenghi-cookbook

Heat a large sautée pan on very high heat, then add a thin film of olive oil, followed by the sausage. Sear the sausage well, then set it aside.

Let the pan regain its heat, then add some more olive oil, followed by the carrot. Let the carrot caramelize, about five minutes, till it smells intensely sweet and the oil has turned orange. Set the carrot aside with the sausage. Add some more olive oil to the pan if it looks dry.

Add the onions, bell pepper, and garlic, along with some salt. Reduce the heat to medium. Scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pan and let the vegetables soften for ten to fifteen minutes. Then remove them and set aside with the carrots and sausage.

Drain the rice and add it to the pan, increasing the heat to high. Stir well and make sure each grain of rice is coated with oil. Then add the first half of the za’atar. When the rice has turned tan and smells fragrant, add in the sausage, vegetables, and chicken stock, as well as more salt to taste. Stir to combine, cover, and cook on medium heat for fifteen to twenty minutes, until the rice is softened (though still with a little bite) and the liquid has evaporated. If the rice is looking done but is still too wet, let it cook uncovered for a couple minutes.

Choreg (Armenian Easter Bread) Recipe,Andrew Janjigian,Middle Eastern,"For the Tangzhong:

80g (2.8 ounces; a little over 1/3 cup) whole milk

40g (1.5 ounces; about 1/4 cup) bread flour

For the Dough:

60g (2 ounces; 1/4 cup) whole milk

3 large eggs (165g)

70g (2.3 ounces; about 1/3 cup) sugar

325g (11.25 ounces; about 2 1/2 cups) bread flour

9g (2 1/2 teaspoons) instant yeast

5g (1 1/2 teaspoons) whole nigella seeds

5g (1 1/2 teaspoons) mahlab seeds, ground

9g (1 tablespoon) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight

85g (3 ounces; 6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cold, cut into 1/2-inch dice

To Finish and Bake:

1 large egg (55g), beaten with a pinch of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon (5ml) water

1 tablespoon (9g) hulled sesame seeds

1 teaspoon (3g) nigella seeds","For the Tangzhong: In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier or 10-inch skillet, whisk together 80 grams milk and flour. Set over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture comes together in a thick, mashed potato–like paste, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and using a rubber spatula, scrape into a stand mixer bowl (do not set bowl into stand mixer yet); set aside.

For the Dough: Add milk, eggs, and sugar to flour paste and whisk vigorously until thoroughly combined. Add flour, yeast, nigella, and mahlab. Set bowl onto stand mixer, and, using a dough hook, mix on low speed until just combined and no dry flour remains, 2 to 4 minutes. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes.

Add salt and mix on low speed until thoroughly incorporated, about 1 minute. Add butter, increase speed to medium, and mix until butter is fully incorporated into dough and dough just starts to clear sides of bowl (it will remain webby, sticky, and attached to bottom of bowl), 12 to 15 minutes.

Transfer dough to a lightly-oiled medium bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let sit at warm room temperature (75°F/24°C) for 45 minutes.

Using lightly moistened hands, fold dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl and fold dough 4 more times (total of 6 turns). Cover again with plastic wrap and let sit for 45 minutes.

Repeat folding as described in step 5, cover, and let rest until dough is risen by about half, 30 to 90 minutes. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 12 to 18 hours. If making a large choereg loaf, proceed to step 7; if making rolls, proceed to step 9.

For a Large Choereg: Turn dough onto a clean, lightly-floured surface, but do not deflate. Flour top of dough and cut into 3 equal portions (about 280g or 9.75 ounces each). Roll and shape each portion into an even 5-inch log. Cover with plastic wrap, and rest for 30 minutes.

Lightly flour work surface. Using hands, roll each log from center into a 15-inch rope (do not taper ends). Repeat with remaining dough balls. Arrange strands in parallel, with short ends of ropes facing you, and then gently press together ends of ropes farthest from you, with center rope on top. Separate ends of ropes closest to you in fan shape, leaving center rope in place. Lift right rope over center rope and set it to the right of the left rope. Lift center rope and set it in the rightmost position, where right rope was originally positioned. Lift left rope over now-center rope (originally right rope) and set it in center position. Repeat braiding process until ropes of dough are entirely braided, then gently press ends together to seal. Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at warm room temperature (75°F/24°C) until almost doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Proceed to step 11.

For Rolls: Turn dough onto a clean, lightly-floured surface, but do not deflate. Flour top of dough and cut into 12 equal portions (70g or 2.5 ounces each). Roll and shape each portion into an even 2-inch log. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes.

Using hands, roll each log from center into a 10-inch-long rope. Form rope into loop, leaving 3 inches of overhang on top end. Form into knot by pulling overhang under lower strand and through center of loop. Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet, arranging rolls in a 4-by-3 pattern. Repeat with remaining logs. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at warm room temperature (75°F/24°C) until almost doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

To Finish and Bake: 30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to middle position for a large choereg, or upper-middle position for rolls, and preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Brush surface of dough (loaf or rolls) with egg wash and let rest for 5 minutes. Brush again with egg wash, and sprinkle with sesame and nigella.

For a Large Choereg: Bake until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Using a spatula, remove loaf from baking sheet and return to wire rack. Let cool at least 2 hours before slicing and serving.


For Rolls: Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and let rolls cool on baking sheet at least 15 minutes before serving.","Middle Eastern,Yeast Breads,The Latest",https://www.seriouseats.com/choreg-armenian-easter-bread

Working with 1 dough ball at a time and keeping the rest covered, place dough ball on a work surface and, using your hand, flatten into a 3 1/2-inch disc.

Using your fingers, poke a hole in the center, then gently stretch the dough out, rotating it as you stretch, to form a roughly 4-inch ring. Return to parchment-lined baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough balls.

To Boil, Top, and Bake Ka'ak: Fill a wide pot with 2 inches water. Add grape (or date) molasses and bring to a boil over high heat. Working in batches, add 2 or 3 ka'ak (only as many as can fit with room to spare around each) and boil, turning once, for 30 seconds per side. Using a spider, slotted spoon, or slotted spatula, remove bagels from boiling water and let drain briefly, then return to parchment-lined baking sheets. Sprinkle all over right away with sesame and nigella seed mixture. Repeat with remaining ka'ak, making sure to keep boiled and topped ka'ak covered until ready to bake.

Working with 1 baking sheet at a time, bake ka'ak until golden brown all over, 20 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.

Fried Squid Po' Boy with Avocado and Black Chile Oil Recipe,Nick Kindelsperger,Middle Eastern,"For the Black Chile Oil

8 dried chipotle chiles

2 dried ancho chiles

3/4 cup grapeseed oil

2 tablespoons white wine vinegar

2 tablespoons sugar

1 tablespoon minced garlic

1 tablespoon kosher salt

juice of 1/2 lime

For the Fried Squid Po' Boy

1 pound small squid (both bodies and tentacles), cleaned

3 lemons

kosher salt

vegetable oil for frying

all-purpose flour

1 ripe avocado, halved, pitted, peeled, and sliced

4 soft rolls, split in half","For the black chile oil: If using a gas stove, make sure a fan is on and set an oven or cooling rack on top of the burner. Turn the burner to high, and set the chiles on the rack. Char the chiles over the flame, flipping them from time to time with a pair of tongs. They are done when they puff up and turn black. Set aside to cool. If using an electric stove, place a large cast-iron skillet over high heat, add the chiles, and cook until they have puffed up and blackened. Set aside to cool.

When the chiles are cool, remove the stems and seeds. Add the chiles to a blender or food processor along with the grapeseed oil, white wine vinegar, sugar, garlic, salt, and lime juice. Process until smooth.

For the fried squid po' boy: Cut the squid bodies into 1/4-inch rounds, and chop the tentacles into 1-inch pieces. Add the squid to a bowl along with the juice of one lemon, and a pinch of salt. Toss about one cup of flour into a second bowl.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, pour enough oil to come up about two inches up the sides. Turn the heat to medium-high. Using an oil thermometer to measure, bring the oil to about 350°F.

When the oil is ready, add the squid into the large bowl with flour, and toss until each piece is evenly coated. Shake off any excess. Add as much of the squid to the oil as will fit in one layer. Cook until golden brown, two to three minutes. Remove cooked pieces with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with some salt. Repeat process until all of the squid has been cooked.

On the bottom half of each roll, place a layer of sliced avocado. Divide the fried squid between the four rolls. Top each with about a teaspoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of the black chile oil. And the top halves of the rolls to each and serve.","Sandwiches,North American,Fried Seafood,Squid,Avocado",https://www.seriouseats.com/fried-squid-po-boy-with-avocado-and-black-chile-oil-recipe

Mock Batches (Soft Batch Cookie Copy Cat) Recipe,Stella Parks,Middle Eastern,"5 1/2 ounces all purpose flour

3/4 ounce cornstarch

1/4 ounce powdered milk

1 3/4 ounce milk chocolate, chopped

2 ounces neutral flavored oil like safflower or peanut

2 ounces dark corn syrup

1 1/2 ounce brown sugar

1/4 tsp baking soda

1 egg yolk

1/2 ounce vanilla extract

Orange gel paste food coloring (optional)

1 ounce semi-sweet mini chips, plus 24 extra for decorating","Make and bake the cookies:


Preheat the oven to 350° and have two parchment lined cookie sheets at the ready.


Use a sieve to sift together the flour, cornstarch, and powdered milk. Set aside.


In a medium bowl melt the milk chocolate, either in a microwave or over a water bath, and stir until it has cooled to body temperature. It's important the chocolate is not hot before proceeding to the next step. Once the chocolate has cooled, use a rubber spatula to stir in the oil, corn syrup, brown sugar, baking soda, egg yolk and vanilla extract. If you wish to use dye for a Soft Batch color match, use a toothpick to add just a little to the dough & stir it in with the spatula.


Stir in the dry ingredients all at once with a spatula, fold in the mini-chips last (reserving 24 chips for garnish.)

Shape and bake the cookies:


Use a #60 ice cream scoop to divide the dough into about 24 equal portions. If you don't have a scoop, you can use a plain spoon—just take care, Soft Batch cookies are really quite small. If you'd like especially authentic cookies, roll each portion of dough between your hands and into a perfect sphere. The dough is soft, so its shape will relax slightly after you place it on the cookie sheet.


Place 12 on each cookie sheet, spaced evenly. Garnish each with one mini chip, placed somewhere off center.


Bake for approximately 6 minutes or until the dough has puffed but not fully set. You may need to experiment to find the perfect time, but the important part is to take them out of the oven when the edges appear fully baked, but the center still seems puffed and damp. Do not over bake.

Aging the cookies: Cool the cookies directly on the tray for 10 minutes, then transfer to an airtight container while still slightly warm. Place a sheet of parchment or wax paper between each layer, as the cookies will readily fuse together if touching. Close the lid of the container and age the cookies for at least 24 hours.","Cookies,North American,Baking,Chocolate",https://www.seriouseats.com/mock-batch-homemade-keebler-soft-batch-cookie-copycat-recipe

Nilla Knockoffs Recipe,Stella Parks,Middle Eastern,"8 ounces flour

4 ounces unsalted butter

3 1/2 ounces sugar

1 ounce honey

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 ounce vanilla extract

4 egg yolks

3 ounces cream, plus extra for washing","Make the cookie batter:


Preheat the oven to 325°F and line two cookie sheets with parchment, set aside.


Sift the flour in a sieve.


With a hand or stand mixer (fitted with a paddle attachment), cream together the butter, sugar, honey, baking soda, salt and vanilla extract. Cream for about 5 minutes on medium speed, until light and fluffy. About halfway through the mixing, scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula.


After 5 minutes, with the mixer still running, add the eggs yolks, one at a time. Let each addition fully incorporate before adding the next.


Turn the mixer to low and add in the flour all at once. While it is mixing, drizzle in the cream. Continue mixing until homogenous. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the batter to a piping bag, fitted with a 1/2"" plain tip.

Pipe and bake the cookies:


Pipe the cookies into 1"" wide rounds on the prepared cookie sheets. Don't worry if they have little peaks, you'll fix those later. Just try to keep the cookies all roughly the same size to ensure even baking.


Once all of the cookies have been piped, brush each one lightly with a pastry brush dipped in cream. You're not looking to coat the cookies, but to smooth the peaks down and give them an even, smooth surface texture.


Once the cookies have been brushed, bake approximately 18 minutes or until the cookies are firm to the touch and golden brown. To make perfectly round wafers, use a 1 1/2"" cookie cutter to trim each cookie before they cool.


Transfer the cookies, while still slightly warm, to an airtight container and seal. This will slightly steam the cookies and give them that less than crisp Nilla texture. If you prefer a crisper wafer, allow the cookies to cool completely before storing.


The cookies will keep, at room temperature, for several weeks.","Cookies,North American",https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-vanilla-wafers-nilla-wafer-knockoffs-copycat-recipe

18 ounces powdered sugar (use 20 ounces for vanilla version)

6 ounces water, divided

2 teaspoons salt

1/2 ounce vanilla extract

1 1/2 ounces cocoa powder (omit for vanilla version)

Sprinkles to garnish","Make and bake the cake layers:


Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two jelly roll style sheet pans with a sheet of parchment.


With a hand or stand mixer, cream together the sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, almond extract, vanilla extract and butter. Cream for about 6 minutes on medium speed, or until light and fluffy. Stop about halfway through to scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula.


While the mixture is creaming, sift the flour through a sieve and set aside.


While still mixing at medium speed, begin adding in the yolks, one at a time. Mix thoroughly after each addition.


Turn the mixer to low speed and, with it still running, add half of the flour. Drizzle in half the milk. Repeat with the remaining flour, milk and rum. Continue mixing only until homogenous.


Shut off the mixer and scrape the bowl down with a spatula and stir, if necessary, to incorporate any lumps of batter around the sides of the bowl.


Divide the batter evenly between the two sheet pans and use an offset spatula to spread the batter into an even layer. Rap the pans against the counter a few times to dislodge any air bubbles.


Bake for five minutes. You'll notice at this time some uneven bubbling occurring in the cakes. Remove the cakes from the oven and shake gently or rap against the counter to deflate the bubbles. Rotate the cake pans and continue baking another five minutes or until uniformly pale-golden and spongy to the touch.


Set aside to cool until needed.

Make the filling:


In a small pot, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat.


In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, sugar, cornstarch and cocoa. While whisking, drizzle in the hot milk. Return the milk/egg mixture to the pot and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly. Whisk until the mixture begins to bubble and continue mixing one minutes more, to thoroughly cook out the cornstarch.


Use a spatula to transfer the cooked custard to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add in the chocolate and salt. Using the paddle attachment, beat on low speed for 10 minutes, or until the mixture and the bowl itself have become cool to the touch.


Once cool, turn the speed up to medium and, with the mixer still running, add the butter one tablespoon at a time, then drizzle in the vanilla. Shut off the mixer and let stand until needed.

Assemble and cut the cakes:


Run a knife around the edges of the cake pans to loosen the cakes. Place a sheet of parchment over both cakes. Next you need to invert both cakes, remove the parchment paper from their bottoms, then re-invert them right-side up.


More detailed explanation: invert one of the cakes onto a cutting board, set the sheet pan aside, and very gently peel away the bottom layer of parchment. Invert the second cake onto the bottom of the now empty sheet pan from the first cake (it's easier to handle the cake when it's on the bottom of the sheet pan, rather than nestled down into the sheet pan and hard to access). Likewise, peel away parchment paper. Now re-invert this second cake to the bottom of its original sheet pan. You now have both cakes right side up, one on a cutting board, one on an upside down sheet pan.


Use a rubber spatula to transfer all of the chocolate buttercream from the bowl to the cake resting on the cutting board. With an offset spatula, spread the buttercream out as evenly as possible, from corner to corner. Hold the sheet pan with the second cake over the buttercreamed cake; gently slide the cake off the sheet pan and on to the buttercream. Press the cake down gently with your fingers to ensure the layers are even.


Wrap the cutting board in plastic and freeze for one hour. Freezing the cake solidifies the buttercream and makes cutting it into tidy shapes much easier.


To cut into Christmas trees, remove the cake from the freezer and cut lengthwise into two long strips, 4"" wide. There will be a 2"" strip leftover for snacking.


Cut each strip with a chef's knife in a zig zag pattern to create a series of isosceles triangles, 3"" wide at the base.


Arrange all of the triangles to their narrowest end points away from you. This is the basic shape of the tree. Trim away a small notch on either side of the base of the triangle to leave behind a 1"" wide trunk shape.


Cover the trees loosely in plastic and freeze or refrigerate until needed.

Prepare the glaze:


In the smallest pot you have that will accommodate the ingredients, combine the powdered sugar, half the water, salt and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine. Set the pot over medium low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the powdered sugar has dissolved and the mixture just beings to bubble. Remove from heat. Set aside a 1/2 cup of this vanilla glaze.


Now add in the remaining water and cocoa powder (if using) and whisk until combined. Cool to room temperature.

Glaze and decorate the cakes:


Have a sheet pan lined with parchment paper ready.


Remove the cakes from the freezer and drop one straight into the center of the glaze. Use a fork to splash some glaze over the top of the cake. Next, lift the cake up and out of the glaze. Let any excess glaze drip back into the pot. Lightly drag the bottom of the cake/fork against the edge of the pot to minimize dripping and excess glaze. Gently place the cake onto the prepared sheet pan.


Repeat with the remaining cakes. For a thick, dark coating, let the cakes dry for about an hour, then make a second batch of glaze (reserving none of the vanilla) and dip the cakes again. If given only one glaze, the cake will show through the glaze in patches. Whether you dip a second round is entirely up to your sense of perfectionism; one glaze is all it takes for a delicious cake.


Once all of the cakes have been glazed, drizzle with the remaining vanilla glaze (tint the glaze red, if making the vanilla version). If the glaze has become too firm to drizzle, add in a teaspoon of water and stir to thin. Drizzle with a spoon, or with a pastry bag fitted with a small, plain tip. Finally, scatter sprinkles all over.


Place the tray of cakes in a well ventilated and safe location where they may dry, undisturbed by pets or children. Let the cakes stand, uncovered, for about six hours or until the glaze has set. Exactly how long this takes will depend on the air flow and humidity in your home.


Once the glaze has set, the cakes are ready for snacking! (Use a spatula to lift the cakes from the parchment, once free, you can handle them easily.)


The cakes will store, covered, at room temperature for about 2 days, or up to a week in the fridge.","Cakes,North American,Christmas Cookies,Christmas Desserts",https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-little-debbie-christmas-cakes-recipe

Immediately shut off the heat, remove the vanilla bean pod, and add the chopped chocolate. Stir with a rubber spatula until homogenized. Next stir in the dark corn syrup and cold cream.


Set this mixture aside until cool. If the mixture is too warm, it will melt the chocolate chips. You can stir to speed this along, or just wait. Once the mixture has cooled, stir in the reserved vanilla bean seeds, brown sugar, baking soda, egg yolk, and Frangelico.

Coarse sea salt","Season ribeye well with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast-iron skillet over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add steak and cook, flipping every 30 seconds or so with a pair of tongs, until a pale golden brown crust starts to develop, about 4 minutes total.

Add two tablespoons of butter to skillet. Continue flipping steak every 30 seconds, while using a spoon to baste the steak with foaming butter. (See here for a step-by-step slideshow of the process. If butter starts to smoke excessively, reduce heat to medium. Continue process until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 125°F (for medium rare), 8 to 10 minutes total.

Chocolate-Frosted Heart-Shaped Doughnuts Recipe,Alexandra Penfold,Middle Eastern,"For the Doughnuts:

1 1/4 cup whole milk, warmed to 90°F

3/4 cup sugar

2 1/4 teaspoons (1 package) active dry yeast

2 whole large eggs, room temperature

12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

2 1/2 cups bread flour

2 cups all purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 quarts neutral oil, for frying

For the Glaze:

8 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/4 cup whole milk

1 tablespoon light corn syrup

5 ounces high quality (70% cacao) bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped

1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1 3/4 cups confectioners sugar","In a small bowl, combine warm milk and two tablespoons of sugar. Sprinkle yeast on top, stir gently then cover with plastic wrap and allow the mixture to proof for five minutes.

In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, melted butter, and vanilla and set aside. In the bowl of the stand mixer, combine the remaining sugar, flours and salt. Fit mixer with the dough attachment. With the mixer on low speed, add milk mixture until fully combined, then increase speed to medium to form a dry-looking dough. Return speed to low then add the egg mixture and mix until it is fully incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and knead for approximately 10 minutes, stopping as needed to scrape the dough off the hook. Dough will be ready when it is very smooth and elastic. Grease a large bowl with vegetable oil or cooking spray and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Prepare two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Lightly flour your work surface and turn your dough out. Dust your hands and the top of the dough with flour then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Use a heart shaped cookie cutter to cut out and a 1-inch biscuit cutter to cut the holes in the center. Combine and re-roll any scraps to cut out additional doughnuts.

Place the doughnuts on the prepared baking sheets leaving room for the doughnuts to expand during proofing. Place the trays in a warm spot to proof until they puff up, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

While doughnuts are proofing, prepare your glaze. In a medium saucepan combine butter, milk, and corn syrup. Heat over medium until butter has just melted. Decrease the heat to low, then whisk in chocolate until fully incorporated. Remove pan from heat and whisk in vanilla and confectioners sugar until smooth. Set mixture over a bowl of warm water, stir as needed to keep it from hardening.

Fill a Dutch oven or deep fryer with 2-inches of oil. Heat oil over medium high heat to 350°F. Doughnuts will be fragile. Carefully transfer, one at a time to a shallow, heat resistant strainer. Use the strainer to gently drop doughnuts in the oil and fry until a deep golden brown on both sides (about 2 minutes per side, use the color as your guide as the oil temperature can very with time). Use wooden chopsticks to turn the doughnuts. Be careful not to crowd the doughnuts in the pan (no more than 2 doughnuts at a time). Remove doughnuts immediately from the pan using a heat resistant strainer or tongs. Tear apart your first doughnut to test for doneness and adjust your cooking time as needed. Set on baking racks to cool.

Once doughnuts are cooled enough to touch, dip them in glaze, decorate with sprinkles, if desired, then return them to the racks so the glaze can set completely, about 30 minutes. Doughnuts are best the day they are made, but leftovers can be stored in an airtight container for a day.","Doughnuts,North American",https://www.seriouseats.com/heart-shaped-chocolate-frosted-doughnuts

In a mixing bowl, combine the melted chocolate mixture with the sugar. When combined, add the eggs. Mix till smooth, then fold in the flour. Transfer to the baking pan. Bake until the brownies feel firm and a paring knife poked into the center comes out clean (you still want a few crumbs to stick), about 30 minutes.

Using the parchment or foil lip, remove the brownies from the pan and cool completely.

Sprinkles Ice Cream Recipe,Max Falkowitz,Middle Eastern,"2 2/3 cups heavy cream

1 1/3 cup whole milk

2 cups fruit-flavored cereal (recommended: Fruity Pebbles; see head note)

6 egg yolks

3/4 cup sugar

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1 cup colored sprinkles","In a large, heavy saucepan, bring cream and milk to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off heat, stir in cereal, cover, and let steep for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until the mixture lightens in color and is fully combined.

Pour cereal-dairy mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl. Push on cereal mush with a spoon to extract as much as much dairy as possible, but don't press flakes of cereal through the strainer. Discard cereal. Strained dairy should yield 3 cups; measure out that amount, adding more cream and milk in a 2 to 1 ratio if needed.

Quickly pour dairy into saucepan with egg yolks and sugar, whisking rapidly to completely combine. Place pot over medium-low heat and cook, whisking frequently, until a custard forms on a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line, or until custard temperature reaches 170°F. Stir in salt to taste.

Strain custard through a fine mesh strainer and either chill in ice bath or in refrigerator until it is very cold, about 40°F.

Fresh and Creamy Lime Pie Recipe,Stella Parks,Middle Eastern,"1/2 recipe Whole Wheat Pie Crust, blind-baked according to recipe directions

For the Filling:

9 ounces sugar (shy 1 1/3 cups; 255g)

1 1/2 ounces cornstarch (about 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 42g)

1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

4 large eggs (about 7 ounces; 195g)

1/4 ounce lime zest (about 2 tablespoons; 7g), from about 4 limes (see note)

8 ounces fresh lime juice (about 1 cup; 225g), from about 8 limes (see note)

16 ounces milk, any percentage will do (about 2 cups; 455g)

1/4 teaspoon rosewater (optional)

For the Topping:

Swiss Meringue, full or half batch as desired","Getting Ready: In a 9-inch glass pie dish, prepare and blind-bake the whole wheat pie crust according to the directions in the recipe. This can be done up to a week in advance; crust can be held at room temperature if wrapped tightly in plastic.

For the Filling: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt and mix until smooth, then whisk in eggs, lime zest, and lime juice, followed by milk. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly but gently, until hot to the touch, about 5 minutes.

Increase heat to medium and continue whisking until thick, about 3 minutes longer. When custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for exactly 2 minutes. (This is important to neutralize a starch-dissolving protein found in egg yolks.) Remove from heat and stir in rosewater, if using. Pour into prepared pie crust. For a silkier texture, first strain through a stainless steel sieve, pushing the thick custard through with a flexible spatula.

For the Topping: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). Prepare Swiss Meringue as directed, making a half or full batch depending on your own personal preference for meringue. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Starting at the very edge of the pie, pipe meringue kisses over surface of custard until completely covered. Alternatively, spread meringue over custard with the back of a spoon. Place on a wire rack set inside a half sheet pan (this setup minimizes heat transfer to the custard) and bake pie until meringue is well browned, about 15 minutes.

To Serve: Cool pie to room temperature, then cover loosely in plastic and refrigerate until no warmer than 60°F (16°C), about 3 1/2 hours. Cut with a wet chef's knife, rinsing the blade clean with cold water between slices. Wrapped in plastic, leftovers can be refrigerated up to 1 week.","Pies,North American,Pie Dough,Lime,Custards, Mousses & Puddings",https://www.seriouseats.com/lime-pie-recipe

Place remaining 1/2 cup flour in a shallow bowl.

Add crabs to plain flour and toss gently to coat. Add beer to flour/cornstarch mixture and whisk until a batter has just formed; it's okay if a few small lumps of dry flour remain.

Working with one at a time, lift a crab from flour and shake off excess. Dip in batter, turning to coat, then lift, allowing excess batter to drain back into bowl. Carefully lower crab into hot oil. Repeat with remaining crabs.

Cook, turning at least once, until batter is golden and crispy on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Using a slotted fish spatula, transfer crabs to paper towels to drain and sprinkle immediately with salt.

Scrape nut paste into a medium bowl.

Divide paste into 3 even portions. You only need one portion to make this recipe; you can save the rest for future batches or use it as a nut butter in other preparations. To save the extra nut paste: If the paste is thick enough to hold its shape, form the remaining portions into balls, wrap tightly in plastic and then aluminum foil, and freeze for up to 3 months; if the paste is too loose to hold its shape, transfer portions to small zipper-lock bags, press out the air, then seal and freeze for up to 3 months.

Transfer remaining portion of nut paste to a 3-quart saucepan and add 1 quart (1 liter) cold water along with the 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Set over high heat and bring to a boil, whisking to incorporate nut paste. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 30 minutes.

Add maple syrup, then increase heat to high, allowing soup to boil until any separated fats on the surface have emulsified back into the soup. Taste, adding more salt if desired.

To serve, briefly reheat hominy or sweet potato. Ladle hot soup into bowls and garnish with hominy or sweet potato.

Salt and freshly ground black pepper","Place the lentils in a small saucepan, cover with plenty of water, bring to a boil, and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until the lentils have softened but still have a little bite. Drain and set aside.

Peel the onions and slice thinly. Place on a large flat plate, sprinkle with the flour and 1 teaspoon salt, and mix well with your hands. Heat the sunflower oil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan placed over high heat. Make sure the oil is hot by throwing in a small piece of onion; it should sizzle vigorously. Reduce the heat to medium-high and carefully (it may spit!) add one-third of the sliced onion. Fry for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally with a slotted spoon, until the onion takes on a nice golden brown color and turns crispy (adjust the temperature so the onion doesn’t fry too quickly and burn). Use the spoon to transfer the onion to a colander lined with paper towels and sprinkle with a little more salt. Do the same with the other two batches of onion; add a little extra oil if needed.

Wipe the saucepan in which you fried the onion clean and put in the cumin and coriander seeds. Place over medium heat and toast the seeds for a minute or two. Add the rice, olive oil, turmeric, allspice, cinnamon, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and plenty of black pepper. Stir to coat the rice with the oil and then add the cooked lentils and the water. Bring to a boil, cover with a lid, and simmer over very low heat for 15 minutes.

Remove from the heat, lift off the lid, and quickly cover the pan with a clean tea towel. Seal tightly with the lid and set aside for 10 minutes.

Finally, add half the fried onion to the rice and lentils and stir gently with a fork. Pile the mixture in a shallow serving bowl and top with the rest of the onion.","Lentils,Middle Eastern,Vegetarian Mains,White Rice,Vegetable Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/mejadra-from-jerusalem
Kanafeh (Middle Eastern Cheese and Phyllo Dessert) Recipe,Sohla El-Waylly,Canadian,"8 ounces (225g) nabulsi, akkawi, or mozzarella cheese, roughly chopped or shredded

2/3 cup (5 ounces; 140g) clotted cream, crème fraîche, or cream cheese

1 pound (454g) shredded phyllo, thawed

1 1/2 cups (12 ounces; 340g) ghee, melted

1 1/2 cups (11.5 ounces; 320g) sugar

2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) lemon juice, from about 1 lemon

1 teaspoon rose water

1/2 teaspoon orange blossom water

3/4 cup (3 ounces; 84g) chopped, toasted pistachios","Getting Started: Set the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (204°C).

To Make The Kanafeh: In a medium bowl, combine the cheese and clotted cream and set aside. With a serrated knife, slice the shredded phyllo crosswise into 1/4- to 1/2-inch lengths and transfer to a large bowl. Pour the melted ghee over the phyllo and, using your hands, toss and mix the phyllo with the ghee in a gentle rubbing motion to ensure that all the phyllo shreds are evenly coated, about 5 minutes.

Transfer half the coated phyllo to a 10-inch cast iron skillet, evenly distributing it along the bottom of the pan. Use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to firmly pack the phyllo, creating an even crust. Top this with the cheese mixture, spreading it evenly over the first phyllo layer and leaving a 1/2-inch border along the rim. Spread the remaining phyllo over the cheese and once again firmly pack it down. Bake in the preheated oven until deeply golden brown, about 40 minutes.

For The Syrup: Prepare the syrup while the kanafeh bakes. In a medium sauce pot, add the sugar, lemon juice, and 1 cup of water. Simmer until the syrup reaches 234°F (112°C), or when a small amount dropped into ice water forms a soft ball. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly. When the kanafeh is ready, finish the syrup by adding the rose and orange blossom waters.

To Serve: After removing the kanafeh from the oven, immediately drizzle on about 1/3 of the syrup. Invert the pie onto a serving platter and drizzle with the remaining syrup. Sprinkle with chopped nuts and serve right away.","Baking,Desserts,Middle Eastern,Pastries,Cheese",https://www.seriouseats.com/kanafeh-middle-eastern-cheese-and-phyllo-dessert
Basic Hummus Recipe from Ottolenghi's 'Jerusalem',Kate Williams,Canadian,"1 1/2 cups/250 g dried chickpeas

1 teaspoon baking soda

6 1/2 cups/1.5 liters water

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/270 g light tahini paste

4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

4 cloves garlic, crushed

6 1/2 tablespoons/100 ml ice-cold water

salt","The night before, put the chickpeas in a large bowl and cover them with cold water at least twice their volume. Leave to soak overnight.

The next day, drain the chickpeas. Place a medium saucepan over high heat and add the drained chickpeas and baking soda. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the water and bring to a boil. Cook, skimming off any foam and any skins that float to the surface. The chickpeas will need to cook between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness, sometimes even longer. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking up easily when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.

Drain the chickpeas. You should have roughly 3 2/3 cups/600 g now. Place the chickpeas in a food processor and process until you get a stiff paste. Then, with the machine still running, add the tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and allow it to mix for about 5 minutes, until you get a very smooth and creamy paste.

Transfer the hummus to a bowl, cover the surface with plastic wrap, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. If not using straightaway, refrigerate until needed. Make sure to take it out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before serving.","Hummus,Middle Eastern,Vegetarian Snacks & Appetizers,Chickpeas",https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-hummus-from-jerusalem-ottolenghi

Tahini sauce, hummus, and/or zhug (Yemenite hot sauce) for serving","Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, adding enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, drain, rinse, and carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner.

Combine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the sides as necessary. A handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball should be able to barely hold together. If not, process a little more.

Transfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas. This will help the balls retain their shape better once formed. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into your hand. Gently shape each into a ball (you will not be able to roll the mixture like cookie dough; this is okay) and place them on a clean plate.

When all the balls have been formed, fill a deep cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet or Dutch oven with 3/4 inch of oil. Heat over high heat until oil registers 375°F on an instant-read thermometer. Carefully lower chickpea balls into oil one at a time, allowing a little space between each ball and cooking in batches if necessary. Adjust heat as necessary to maintain a temperature of between 350 and 375°F. Allow to cook undisturbed until well browned on bottom sides, then carefully flip balls with a fork until browned on second side, about 4 minutes total.

1 1/2 pounds (680g) green, French green (Le Puy), or yellow lentils

1 bay leaf

2 large (10-ounce; 280g) yellow onions, sliced 1/2-inch-thick

1 pound (450g) plum tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces

2 tablespoons minced fresh dill or cilantro","In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine chicken with enough water to cover. Add 1 tablespoon (10g) salt and bring to just under a simmer (roughly 180°F/80°C on an instant-read thermometer). Cook, maintaining a sub-simmer as best you can, until chicken registers 160°F (70°C) deep in the thigh, about 45 minutes.

Carefully lift chicken from poaching liquid, allowing it to drain back into pat, then transfer to a work surface and allow to cool. Reserve poaching liquid. Clean the pot or Dutch oven.

In the same pot or Dutch oven, combine 1/2 cup (120ml) oil with garlic and ginger and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until garlic and ginger begin to gently sizzle and are just beginning to turn lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add coriander, cumin, turmeric, paprika, black pepper, and pepper flakes and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until spices are lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes longer.

Stir in lentils, then add enough of the reserved poaching broth to just cover lentils. Add bay leaf. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, then adjust heat to maintain simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally and adding more poaching liquid to keep lentils just covered throughout, until lentils are very tender and just beginning to break down, about 1 hour; use additional water as needed if you run out of poaching liquid before the lentils have finished cooking.

While lentils are cooking, remove skin from the poached chicken; if desired, finely mince the chicken skin and add it to the lentils (it will meld into the lentils during cooking and enrich the stew, but you can omit if desired). Pull meat from chicken bones and shred; discard bones.

When lentils are tender and beginning to break down, add shredded chicken and continue to cook, stirring often to prevent sticking and adding poaching liquid or water little by little as needed to keep lentils from becoming overly thick and sludgy, until some of the lentils have begun to break down and thicken the stew, about 15 minutes longer. Discard bay leaf. Season with salt and keep warm.

Meanwhile, in a large 12-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat remaining 1/2 cup (120ml) oil over high heat until very lightly smoking. Add onions, season with salt, and cook, stirring often, until deeply browned in spots and beginning to soften, about 15 minutes; lower heat as needed to prevent burning. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently, until tomatoes begin to break down, about 7 minutes; reduce heat even more as needed to prevent burning.

1 tablespoon granulated sugar

2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 cup whole wheat flour (2 1/2 ounces; 70g)

2 cups all-purpose flour (10 ounces; 280g), plus more for dusting","In a medium mixing bowl, combine water, oil, sugar, yeast, salt, and whole wheat flour with a wooden spoon until combined and smooth. Stir in all-purpose flour until the mixture comes together into a shaggy mass.

Using clean hands, knead the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or until it becomes smooth and very elastic, adding only very small amounts of extra flour if dough is extremely sticky (see note). Alternatively, knead dough at low speed in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment until dough is very elastic and smooth, about 8 minutes.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and form into a smooth ball. Lightly oil a clean mixing bowl and place dough inside, then rub oiled hands over the top of the dough. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, place a baking steel or 12-inch cast iron skillet on the top oven rack and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Line a plate with a large, clean kitchen towel and set aside.

Punch down the dough, transfer to a lightly floured work surface, and cut into 6 even pieces. Form each dough piece into an even ball. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.

Roll each piece of dough into about a 7-inch circle, no more than 1/4 inch thick, taking care not to tear dough and keeping the thickness even all around. Place dough disks on a lightly floured surface, cover with a damp towel, and let proof until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.

Working with as many pitas as will fit on the steel at once, pick up each pita and place on the steel top side down. (If using a cast iron skillet, bake one pita at a time.) Immediately close the oven door and bake until pitas have puffed and are slightly golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to over-bake.

Place baked pitas onto towel-lined plate and wrap with the overhanging towel. Repeat with any remaining pitas.

Kosher salt","If Using a Grill (recommended): Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat and place eggplants directly over heat source. Cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until eggplants are completely tender and well charred on all sides, 30 to 40 minutes. Wrap with foil and let rest 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.

If Using the Broiler: Adjust rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place eggplants on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and prick all over with a fork. Broil, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides and completely tender, about 30 minutes (timing may vary depending on broiler strength). Eggplants should be very, very tender when cooked; if eggplant is not fully tender once skin is charred all over, switch oven to 425°F and roast until fully tender (a toothpick or skewer inserted near the stem and bottom ends should not meet any resistance). Remove from oven and gather up foil, crimping it around the eggplants to form a sealed package. Let the eggplants rest for 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.

Open foil package. Working with one eggplant at a time, use a sharp paring knife to slit each eggplant open lengthwise. Carefully scoop out soft flesh with a large spoon and transfer to a strainer set in a large bowl. Once all eggplant is scooped, pick out any stray bits of skin and blackened flesh and discard.

Transfer eggplant to a salad spinner, distributing it evenly around the perimeter. Spin gently until all excess moisture is extracted. Discard all drippings, wipe out large bowl, and return eggplant to bowl.

Add garlic and lemon juice to eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks down into a rough paste, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stirring constantly and vigorously, add tahini, followed by the olive oil in a thin, steady stream. The mixture should become pale and creamy. Stir in parsley and season to taste with salt, plus more lemon juice if desired.

Season the marinade to taste with kosher salt and black pepper. Place the chicken in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and add half of the marinade (reserve the remaining marinade in the refrigerator). Turn the chicken to coat, seal the bag, and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, turning occasionally to redistribute the marinade (see Note).

Remove the chicken from the bag and pat it dry with paper towels. Season with kosher salt and pepper, going heavy on the pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat until it is lightly smoking. Add the chicken pieces and cook without disturbing until they are lightly browned on the first side, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the center of each thigh registers 165°F. on an instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and allow to cool for 5 minutes.

Using a chef’s knife, roughly chop the chicken into 1/2- to 1/4-inch chunks. Transfer to a medium bowl, add the remaining marinade, cover loosely with plastic, and refrigerate while you cook the rice and prepare the sauce.

For the rice: Melt the butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven. Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes without disturbing. Remove from the heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.

For the sauce: In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, parsley, and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Whisk to combine. Season to taste with salt.

To serve: Return the entire contents of the chicken bowl (chicken, marinade, and all juices) to the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through. To serve, divide the rice, lettuce, tomato, and toasted pita bread evenly among four to six plates. Pile the chicken on top of the rice. Top with the white sauce and hot sauce. Serve immediately, passing extra sauce at the table.","Chicken Thighs,Middle Eastern,White Rice,Rice & Grains",https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe

2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (for table salt, use 1 teaspoon)

1/4 cup (60g) fresh juice from about 2 lemons, divided

1/4 cup (60g) ice water, divided

3 cups (600g) neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, divided","Using a paring knife, split each garlic clove in half lengthwise. With the tip of the knife, remove the germ from each garlic clove half.

Food Processor Method: Place the de-germed garlic and kosher salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse garlic in short bursts, occasionally removing the lid to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible rubber spatula, until finely minced. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and continue processing until a paste begins to form. Add another tablespoon lemon juice and process until completely smooth and slightly fluffy.

With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup oil in a very thin stream, followed by 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Repeat with another 1/2 cup oil and remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Continue the process, alternating 1/2 cup oil and 1 tablespoon water, until all the oil and water have been incorporated. Transfer toum to a container and store in the fridge for up to 1 month.

Mortar and Pestle Method: Depending on the size of your mortar, you may need to make the recipe in smaller batches, halving or quartering the ingredient amounts. In the mortar, combine garlic and salt and grind until it becomes a smooth paste. Work oil into paste 1 teaspoon at a time. After adding 1 tablespoon oil, work in a few drops of lemon juice. Repeat until all the oil, lemon juice, and water have been incorporated.

Khao Piak Sen (Lao Chicken-Noodle Soup) Recipe,Jenny Dorsey,Italian,"For the Fried Garlic and Shallot:

1 cup vegetable oil (240ml)

24 cloves garlic (120g), sliced thinly crosswise, preferably with a mandoline

3 medium shallots (150g), sliced thinly crosswise into rounds, preferably with a mandoline

For the Broth and Chicken:

1 medium yellow onion (10 ounces; 280g), peeled and quartered through the root end

3 large knobs ginger (3 ounces; 90g), peeled and sliced crosswise into 1/4 inch thick rounds

3 tablespoons garlic and shallot oil (45ml), from above

To Finish and Serve the Soup:

2 scallions, sliced thinly on the bias

2 fresh bird’s eye chilies, stemmed and minced

5 sprigs morning glory, pulled through a morning glory shredder (optional; see note)

Lime wedges

Fried garlic, from above

Fried shallots, from above

Picked cilantro leaves and tender stems","For the Fried Garlic and Shallot: Line a plate with paper towels and set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium heatproof bowl. In a medium frying pan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and fry, swirling and stirring frequently, until golden brown all over, approximately 4 minutes. Pour garlic and oil into prepared strainer and allow to drain. Transfer garlic to the prepared paper towels, spreading it out in an even layer, and allow to drain further.

Return oil to pan, then set fine-mesh strainer over the same heatproof bowl. Line a second plate with clean paper towels.

Add shallots to pan and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until shallots begin to bubble, about 1 minute. Continue cooking, stirring constantly as the shallots fry to ensure even cooking, until shallots turn pale golden brown, about 3 minutes longer. Working quickly, pour contents of saucepan into strainer set over bowl. (Shallots will continue cooking for a brief period after draining, so do not allow them to get too dark.) Reserve garlic-shallot oil.

For the Broth and Chicken: If desired, grill or sear (in a cast iron pan without oil) two of the onion quarters and two-thirds of the sliced ginger until well charred, about 2 minutes per cut side (this will add depth and complexity to the broth, but is optional).

Roughly chop all of the onion and ginger, whether charred or not.

In a large 8-quart Dutch oven or soup pot, heat garlic-shallot oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add chopped onion and ginger, lemongrass, sliced garlic, lime leaves, and cilantro stems, season lightly with salt, then cook, stirring, until onions are softened, about 7 minutes.

Add chicken to pot and top with at least 5 quarts (5 liters) cold water, or enough to cover. Add the 2 tablespoons kosher salt along with the soy sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, covered, for 2 hours, lifting lid occasionally to skim the surface of broth of any foam or scum that accumulates.

Carefully remove chicken from the pot and transfer to a work surface (it may fall apart after this long cooking; simply fish out all the parts and bones). When cool enough to handle, pull meat from bones and shred with your hands or a fork. Discard bones and skin. Reserve chicken meat.

Meanwhile, bring broth to a rolling boil and cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Strain broth, discarding solids, then return to cleaned pot. Season with salt.

While the Broth Simmers, Make the Noodles: In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add 7 ounces rice flour and 7 ounces tapioca flour. Turn mixer to medium-low speed and drizzle in boiling water. Continue to mix, pausing occasionally to scrape down the sides with a flexible spatula, until a moist dough ball forms, about 3 minutes.

Whisk together remaining rice and tapioca flours, then sprinkle on a work surface. Turn dough ball out onto floured work surface. Knead dough by hand until all of the flour on the board has been fully incorporated into a supple dough, about 4 minutes.

Roll dough into a thick log and divide into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a small ball, then flatten with the palm of your hand.

Working one dough disc at a time, and keeping the remainder covered with a kitchen towel to prevent drying, roll using a rolling pin until roughly 1/8 inch thick and about 6 inches long.

Using a sharp knife, slice into noodles roughly 1/4 inch wide. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, dusting and tossing gently with rice flour to prevent sticking. Keep noodles covered with a damp towel so they don’t dry out. Repeat with remaining dough.

To Finish and Serve the Soup: Add noodles to boiling finished broth and cook, stirring very minimally to prevent them from breaking (they're brittle until they cook through), until noodles float to the surface, 1-2 minutes.

Transfer noodles to soup bowls. Add shredded chicken to each bowl. Ladle broth into bowls. Serve hot, allowing diners to garnish their soup with scallions, chilies, morning glory (if using), lime, fried garlic, fried shallots, and cilantro leaves and tender stems.

Thai Sticky Rice (Khao Niao) Recipe,Sasha Marx,Italian,4 cups (28 ounces; 800g) Thai sticky rice (see note),"In a large bowl, cover rice with cool water for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Alternatively, to speed up the process, use hot water, and soak the rice for at least 2 hours.

Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain the rice, discarding the cloudy soaking water. Refill the bowl with cool water so that when the fine-mesh strainer is set inside it, the rice in the strainer is fully submerged under water. Using your hands, stir the rice in the strainer to release starch into the water, making it cloudy. Lift the strainer with the rice out of the bowl, and discard the soaking water. Repeat this process until the water in the bowl is mostly clear, about 3 more times.

Assemble a steamer, filling the bottom with 1 to 2 inches of water, and lining the steamer basket with a double-layer of damp cheesecloth that has a 3-inch overhang over the sides of the basket. Transfer rice to cheesecloth-lined steamer basket, and use your hands to pat rice into an even layer. Fold overhanging cheesecloth over the rice to form a parcel, then cover with a lid.

Bring water in steamer to a boil over high heat, place steamer basket over it, and lower heat to a steady simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, then remove lid and carefully flip parcel of rice over. Cover again with lid, and continue to cook until rice is tender, but still chewy, about 10 minutes longer.

Remove from heat, and flip bundle over once more so that the folded over parts of cheesecloth are facing you. Transfer rice to a heatproof bowl and cover it with a plate (you can discard the cheesecloth at this point, or if you used a bamboo steamer and wish to use the steamer basket as a serving vessel, keep the rice in its cheesecloth parcel and unwrap it right before serving). Let rice cool slightly for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Serve immediately.

1 3/4 cup (400 ml) unsweetened coconut milk

1/2 cup (125 ml) water

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup (100 g) sugar

2 ripe mangoes, peeled, deseeded and diced","Soak the tapioca in the 1 cup (250 ml) of water in a small bowl for 30 minutes.

While the tapioca is soaking, make the rice balls. Combine the rice flour with the 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water in a large bowl and mix until a dough comes together. The dough should be slightly tacky and you should be able to form the dough into a large sphere. If the dough is too dry and crumbly, slowly add more water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough can hold its shape.

Form the rice flour balls by pinching off about a teaspoon of the dough and rolling it between your palms to form a small sphere about 1/2 in (1.25 cm) in diameter. You should be able to make about 20 small rice balls from the dough. Cover the rice balls with a damp paper towel and set aside.

Drain the tapioca in a fine-mesh sieve set over the sink and rinse with cold running water. Allow the tapioca to continue draining over the sink.

To make the porridge, combine the coconut milk with the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water in a large saucepan. Stir in the salt and the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and then add the rice balls to the saucepan and gently simmer, stirring to ensure the rice balls don’t stick to each other. Continue simmering the rice balls until they are cooked through and become pleasantly chewy, 3–5 minutes. As the rice balls simmer, they will become firmer and expand slightly.

Increase the heat to high and return the liquid to a boil. As soon as the liquid boils, turn off the heat and stir in the drained tapioca pearls. Continue to stir until the tapioca becomes tender and translucent, 2–3 minutes. If the porridge becomes too thick for your liking, you can thin it out with more water or coconut milk.

4g vital wheat gluten (see note)","To Make Noodles: Add baked baking soda to water and stir to dissolve completely, about 1 minute. Add salt, and stir until dissolved completely.

Combine vital wheat gluten and bread flour in the bowl of a food processor fitted with metal blade, or in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Process until thoroughly mixed, about 30 seconds in a food processor or 1 minute on low speed in a stand mixer.

Increase speed to medium-low and, with machine running, add 1/3 of liquid at a time, allowing time between each addition for liquid to be fully absorbed, about 30 seconds. After final addition, allow machine to run until flour and water mixture looks pebbly, about 1 minute. If using food processor, stop machine and let rest for 30 minutes. If using stand mixer, stop machine, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let rest for 30 minutes. (This pause is to allow the flour to more fully absorb the liquid.)

Press dough into a ball and divide into two roughly equal portions. Place both in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to prevent them drying out.

Working with one portion at a time, flatten balls to a thickness of about 1/5 inch (the dough will be very stiff, so do the best you can, as it will make it easier to run through the pasta rollers). Run flattened disk through widest setting of pasta roller, followed by the second widest setting, followed by the third widest setting, followed by the fourth widest setting. Fold dough sheet in half, so it is half of its original length, then repeat entire process two times (it will become significantly harder to run the doubled up dough through the rollers in each iteration). If done correctly, longitudinal lines will form on the sheet of dough. Wrap dough sheet in plastic wrap or place, folded, in zip top bag, and repeat process with the remaining portion. Let dough sheet rests for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.

Working with one dough sheet at a time, run dough through progressively narrower settings on your pasta machine, until it reaches the thickness you desire (~1-1.5 mm). Run final dough sheet through the spaghetti cutting attachment; dust noodles with flour or corn starch to prevent sticking, shake off excess starch or flour, and fold into loose nests. Alternatively, dust dough sheet with flour, fold it, dust again with flour, and fold again, to form a stack of dough. Using a sharp knife, cut through dough at regular intervals to produce noodles. Once finished cutting, shake noodles to loosen, and fold into loose nests.

Place noodles in zip-top bag and refrigerate overnight. (Noodles can be used immediately, but they improve significantly in texture and flavor if allowed to age slightly.)

Before Cooking Noodles (optional): Gather noodles into a ball and compress with your palms on a clean, dry surface, using a similar amount of pressure you would use to compress a snowball. Loosen noodles and repeat process, gathering them into a ball and compressing with your palms. (This brief compression gives the noodles their signature curls.)

To Cook Noodles: Bring large pot of unsalted water to rolling boil over high heat. If using noodle baskets, add noodles to baskets and plunge in water, rapidly stirring noodles with tongs or chopsticks in basket to prevent sticking. If not using noodle baskets, add noodles to boiling water and stir vigorously with tongs or chopsticks to prevent sticking. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes if using hand-cut noodles; cook for about 1 minute and 30 seconds if using noodles cut on spaghetti cutter. (The exact cooking time will depend on your preferences and on the thickness of the noodles.) Drain thoroughly, shaking off as much excess water as possible, and add to hot ramen broth.","Dairy-free,Japanese,Vegetarian,Noodle Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-ramen-noodles

4 medium cloves garlic

A mixture of salt, freshly ground black pepper, and ground toasted sesame seeds, for serving","In a medium bowl, cover rice with 1 inch of cold water and soak for 2 hours. Drain rice.

Wash hwanggi and eomnamu under cold running water, using a clean brush to dislodge any grit. Place hwanggi and eomnamu in a large saucepan, cover with 2 quarts (2 liters) cold water, and soak for 2 hours.

Transfer pot to the stovetop and bring to a simmer. Gently simmer hwanggi and eomnamu for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, trim off chickens' wing tips, tail, and excess fat. Clean inside of chicken cavity well, trying to remove any blood stuck between the ribs.

Stuff each chicken with alternating layers of sticky rice, jujubes, gingko, chestnuts, ginseng, and garlic.

Using a paring knife, cut a small slit into the skin on either side of the cavity. Cross the drumsticks, inserting the end of each drumstick through the slit on the opposite side of the cavity (this trusses the bird and seals the cavity without the need for string).

Strain the hwanggi and eomnamu from the broth, discarding the solids. Top up the broth with fresh water to equal 2 quarts (2 liters).

In a heavy, large pot or Dutch oven, arrange the stuffed birds side-by-side. Pour the broth over them. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and gently simmer until the birds are fully cooked through and tender, about 2 hours. If the broth doesn't fully cover the birds, rotate them halfway through cooking.

Transfer each stuffed bird to a deep serving bowl or small earthenware pot and ladle the broth on top. Garnish with scallions and serve with the salt/pepper/sesame seed mixture alongside, so that each person can season the soup and chicken to their tastes.

Japchae (Korean Glass Noodles With Pork and Vegetables) Recipe,Seoyoung Jung,Chinese Cuisine,"For the Mushrooms and Pork:

6 dried wood ear mushrooms (about 5g)

3 1/2 ounces shiitake mushrooms (100g; about 5 medium shiitakes), stems discarded and caps sliced 1/4 inch thick

3 1/2 ounces (100g) lean boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 2- by 1/4-inch strips

2 tablespoons (30ml) yangjo ganjang (Korean wheat-based soy sauce; see note)

2 medium cloves garlic, minced

1 tablespoon granulated sugar

2 teaspoons (10ml) soju

Generous pinch minced peeled fresh ginger

Freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil

For the Jidan (Egg Garnish):

2 large eggs

Vegetable oil, for greasing the pan

For the Carrot and Onion:

2 teaspoons (10ml) vegetable oil

1 small (5-ounce; 140g) yellow onion, thinly sliced pole to pole

1 small (3-ounce; 90g) carrot, cut into julienne

Kosher salt

For the Spinach:

3 ounces curly spinach (90g; about 3 loosely packed cups)

1 small clove garlic, minced

1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

1/2 teaspoon ground roasted sesame seeds

For the Noodles:

5 1/4 ounces (150g) dangmyeon (Korean sweet potato glass noodles; see note)

1 tablespoon (15ml) yangjo ganjang (Korean wheat-based soy sauce; see note)

1 teaspoon brown or granulated sugar

2 teaspoons ground roasted sesame seeds

Toasted sesame oil, for drizzling","For the Mushrooms and Pork: In a medium bowl, cover wood ear mushrooms generously with cold water and let stand until fully rehydrated and softened, about 1 hour. Drain, then tear wood ear mushrooms into smaller strips.

Combine wood ear mushrooms in a small bowl with shiitake mushrooms, pork, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, soju, ginger, and a few grindings of black pepper. Mix thoroughly, then let marinate 20 minutes.

In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork and mushrooms and cook, stirring, until pork is cooked through and mushrooms are just starting to lightly brown. Transfer to a plate.

Meanwhile, for the Jidan (Egg Garnish): Separate egg yolks and whites, passing each component separately through a clean fine-mesh strainer into its own small bowl. (You can use the same strainer for whites and yolks, but wash it between uses.) Very gently mix the contents of each bowl until incorporated, but avoid beating, as you don't want to incorporate air.

Warm a mint-condition 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Using an oiled paper towel, lightly wipe oil all over the surface of the skillet. Scrape yolk into skillet, spreading it around to form a thin, even round. Gently cook until yolk is mostly set, about 1 minute, making sure to manage the heat so that the yolk cooks without browning on the bottom.

Using a flexible rubber spatula, gently lift yolk round and slide a chopstick underneath until you can pick the round up. Lay yolk round down on its other side and continue cooking until fully set but not browned, about 30 seconds. Transfer yolk round to a work surface to cool.

Wipe out skillet, then repeat procedure with egg whites, lightly oiling the pan first with the towel, then making a round of egg whites, being careful to prevent browning.

When the yolk and egg-white rounds have cooled, carefully slice into thin slivers using a very sharp knife. Set aside.

For the Carrot and Onion: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and carrot, season with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until just tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

For the Spinach: In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook spinach until tender, about 1 minute. Using a spider or other wire strainer, remove spinach, allowing excess water to drain off, and transfer to a bowl. (Reserve boiling water for noodles.) Squeeze out any excess water from spinach. Toss spinach with minced garlic, sesame oil, and ground sesame seeds, mixing well to evenly coat. Set aside.

For the Noodles: Add noodles to the boiling water and cook until tender but still chewy (roughly 6 minutes, though this will depend on the brand of noodles you buy). Drain into a colander and rinse noodles with cold running water. Allow to drain well.

Transfer noodles to a large serving or mixing bowl. If the noodle strands are very long, snip them a few times, using kitchen shears, to shorten them to a more manageable length (but be careful not to make the lengths too short).

In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce and sugar, then add this soy sauce mixture to the noodles, tossing well to coat. Add pork and mushrooms, carrot and onion, and slivered eggs. Add ground sesame seeds. Drizzle with sesame oil, then toss until thoroughly mixed. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired.

Add spinach and toss once more to combine. Serve japchae warm or at room temperature.

2 fresh red chili peppers, minced (see note)

1 tablespoon (6g) freshly ground black pepper

1 cup (240ml) Sprite

For the Chicken:

4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds; 675g)

To Finish:

6 ounces (170g) low-moisture mozzarella, shredded

2 scallions, thinly sliced

1 tablespoon (6g) toasted sesame seeds","For the Sauce: In medium bowl, whisk together chicken stock, soy sauce, rice syrup, gochujang, gochugaru, and sesame oil. Set aside.

In medium (3-quart) saucepan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly until vegetables are aromatic, about 1 minute. Add chilies and black pepper and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 30 seconds.

Stir in gochujang mixture and Sprite, and bring to a rapid simmer. Simmer sauce, stirring and scraping down sides of saucepan occasionally with a rubber spatula, until reduced by about half and sauce coats the back of a spoon, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer sauce to heat-proof liquid measuring cup or bowl and set aside to cool (you should have about 1 1/2 cups; 360ml of sauce) to room temperature. Sauce can be refrigerated up to 5 days.

For the Chicken: Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels and place skin-side down on cutting board. Working with one thigh at a time, use a sharp knife to make incisions running along the length of both sides of the bone. Use knife tip to expose bone; then run blade underneath bone to free it from the flesh. Don't worry about scraping meat from bone. Cut bone away from thigh meat, making sure to trim and discard any residual cartilage or bone fragments; reserve bone. Repeat with remaining chicken thighs.

In medium bowl or large zipper-lock bag, toss chicken thighs and bones with half the sauce (about 3/4 cup; 180ml), until well-coated. Cover, transfer to refrigerator, and let marinate for at least 45 minutes and up to overnight.

Adjust oven rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high.


If grilling: Light 1 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate. Grill chicken thighs and bones directly over high heat, starting thighs skin-side down, turning and shifting to cooler side of grill if there are excessive flare-ups, until skin is well-charred and bones are charred on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Using tongs, move bones to cooler side of grill, and flip thighs over and continue to cook until second side is charred and meat is just cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes. Using poultry shears, cut thighs into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Continue to cook over direct heat, brushing pieces with remaining sauce, until chicken is fully cooked but still tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer chicken pieces and bones to 10-inch cast iron skillet.


If broiling: Set wire rack inside a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Arrange chicken thighs and bones on prepared rack, with thighs facing skin-side up.

7g (about 1 tablespoon) coarsely ground black pepper

35g (about 1/4 cup) black sesame seeds

15g (about 2 tablespoons) garlic powder

6g (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) kosher salt

To Cook and Serve:

2L (2 quarts) peanut oil

6 soft buns, such as potato rolls, toasted in butter, or 6 black sesame biscuits

Finely shredded cabbage

Sliced dill pickles","For the Brine: Combine kimchi juice, buttermilk, egg, garlic, salt, soy sauce, gochugaru, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces and toss and turn to coat. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the contents and coat the chicken evenly. Meanwhile, make the kimchi mayonnaise, the sauce, the spice rub, and the dredge.

For the Kimchi Mayonnaise: Place chopped drained kimchi in the middle of a clean kitchen towel and gather up the edges. Twist into a bundle and squeeze tightly over the sink to remove as much excess moisture as you can. Combine kimchi with mayonnaise in a food processor and pulse until kimchi is finely chopped and the mixture has the texture of tartar sauce. Transfer to a sealable container and refrigerate until ready to use.

For the Sauce: Combine oil, garlic, gochugaru, and black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook until mixture begins to sizzle and smell toasty and garlic is just starting to turn pale golden around the edges. Immediately drain through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot or heatproof bowl. Discard solids and allow oil to cool to room temperature.

Combine gochujang, honey, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and a couple tablespoons water in a blender and slowly ramp it up to maximum speed. Drizzle in the chili oil to form an emulsion. Adjust the consistency with more water as needed. The sauce should be runny, but not watery. Transfer to a sealable container and refrigerate until ready to use.

For the Spice Mixture: Combine gochugaru, black pepper, sugar, sesame seeds, and salt in a small bowl. Cover and set aside at room temperature.

For the Dredge: Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, gochugaru, black pepper, sesame seeds, garlic powder, and salt in a large bowl and whisk until homogeneous. Cover and set aside.

To Cook: In a wok or Dutch oven, heat 2 quarts (2L) peanut oil to 325°F (163°C), using an instant-read thermometer to keep it steady at that temperature. Remove 3 tablespoons of the marinade from the zipper-lock bag, add to the dredge mixture, and work marinade into the dredge mixture with your fingertips. Remove 1 piece of chicken from the bag, allowing excess buttermilk to drip off. Drop chicken into dredge mixture and toss to coat. Continue adding chicken pieces to dredge, one at a time, until they are all in the bowl. Toss chicken until every piece is thoroughly coated, pressing with your hands to get the flour to adhere in a thick layer.

Working with one piece at a time, transfer coated chicken to a fine-mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Once all the chicken pieces are coated, gently slip as many into the wok or Dutch oven as can fit comfortably in a single layer. The temperature should drop to 275°F (135°C); adjust heat to maintain a temperature of 275 to 300°F (135 to 149°C) for the duration of the cooking.

Fry chicken until deep golden brown on the first side, about 6 minutes; do not move chicken or start checking for doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off the coating. Using tongs or a flexible fish spatula, carefully flip chicken pieces and cook until second side is golden brown and chicken registers at least 160°F (71°C) when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the deepest part of the thigh, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet.

To Serve: Spread each bottom and top bun (or each biscuit half) with kimchi mayo. Add cabbage and pickles to the bottom half. Brush chicken pieces with sauce until well coated. Sprinkle with spice mixture. Place chicken pieces on top of cabbage, close sandwiches, and serve.

Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish","In a medium bowl, cover rice with at least 2 inches cold water and soak for 1 hour. Drain well.

Meanwhile, in a large Dutch oven or similarly sized pot, combine chicken, whole garlic cloves, ginger, and scallion whites with 2 quarts (2L) cold water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook at a gentle simmer until thickest part of breast close to bone registers 150°F (66°C) on an instant-read thermometer and joint between thighs and body registers at least 175°F (80°C), about 45 minutes.

6 long strips ham for kimbap (each about 1/4 inch or less thick)

1 medium (8-ounce; 240g) carrot, julienned

3 sheets flat odeng fishcake, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips

2 teaspoons (10ml) grain syrup or oligosaccharide syrup (sold as “oligodang” at the Korean markets)

1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce

1 whole danmuji (pickled radish) or 6 pre-cut long danmuji sticks for kimbap

6 long pieces Korean braised burdock root for kimbap

3 long strips of artificial crab meat (surimi in Japanese), cut in half lengthwise for a total of 6

3 cups cooked short-grain (sushi) rice, hot (see note)

1 1/2 tablespoons (22ml) sesame oil, plus more for brushing

1 1/2 tablespoons crushed roasted sesame seeds

6 square sheets gim (sold as nori in Japanese) for gimbap or sushi","Trim cucumber ends and cut it in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scrape out the seeds from each half. Cut each half lengthwise into three long strips to make 6 strips total. Place cucumber strips on a plate, sprinkle all over with salt, and toss well to coat. Set aside.

In a small bowl, beat eggs with a pinch of salt. Lightly grease a 10-inch nonstick skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat until warmed but not sizzling hot. Add half the egg, swirling to cover entire bottom of pan and cook until egg has just set on top. Using a rubber spatula, carefully free the egg round and transfer to a work surface to cool. Lightly re-grease pan if needed and repeat with remaining egg. Wipe out skillet.

Slice egg lengthwise into thin strips. Set aside.

Rinse cucumber under cold running water, then pat dry with towels, squeezing gently to remove excess moisture. Using the same skillet, wipe it lightly with more vegetable oil and set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add cucumber and cook until just slightly softened, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool.

Add ham strips and cook, gently stirring and tossing, until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.

Add the carrot to the skillet with a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring and tossing, until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes; if you need to add a little more oil to the pan, you can do so at any point. Set aside to cool.

Lower heat to medium. Add fishcake strips to skillet along with oligosaccharide syrup and soy sauce and cook, tossing and stirring, until fishcake has softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.

In a large bowl, mix rice with sesame oil, crushed sesame seeds, and 1 teaspoon salt. Divide rice into 6 even portions.

Set a kimbap/sushi rolling mat on a work surface. Set a sheet of nori on top of it. Wearing plastic gloves, place a portion of rice on the seaweed sheet and use both hands to spread it evenly all over, leaving about one or two inches of the sheet exposed at the top edge. Dot a few rice grains along the top edge (they will help it stick together later).

Arrange your fillings across the center of the rice: 1 cucumber stick, some egg strips, 1 ham strip, one-sixth of the carrot, some of the fishcake strips, 1 danmuji strip, 1 burdock strip, and 1 crab stick strip.

Roll the bamboo mat up and away from you, curling the seaweed sheet and rice around the fillings; use the fingers of both your hands to hold the filling in place as you roll with your thumbs. Secure the roll with the exposed flap of seaweed sheet. Once the roll is sealed, gently squeeze, pressing gently on the top and sides, to compress the roll slightly and seal the edge; if it doesn't seal well, you can also wet the seaweed at the seam to help it adhere.

Repeat with remaining seaweed sheets, rice, and fillings.

Lightly brush rolls with sesame oil and lightly rub a sharp knife blade with it as well. Set 2 rolls next to each other, then slice them both into 1/2 inch thick pieces (it's easier to cut through 2 rolls at once than it is to do one at a time).

Chinese Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf (Lo Mai Gai) Recipe,Shao Z.,Chinese Cuisine,"2 cups sticky rice (sweet rice)

For the Marinated Chicken:

1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, sliced thinly

1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

1 teaspoon vegetable or canola oil

1 teaspoon oyster sauce

1/2 teaspoon Shaoxing wine

1 teaspoon dark soy sauce

1/4 teaspoon sugar

1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper

2 pinches kosher salt

For the Sticky Rice Seasoning:

1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine

1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

1 teaspoon oyster sauce

2 teaspoons dark soy sauce

For the Lotus Leaf Packages:

2 dried lotus leaves or 4 sheets of 2-foot-long parchment paper

2 tablespoons small dried shrimp, soaked in water for 5 minutes, then drained, rinsed, and patted dry (optional)

3 teaspoons canola or vegetable oil, divided

1 whole shallot, minced

2 medium garlic cloves, minced

8 dried shiitake mushroom caps, rehydrated in hot water for 15 minutes, then drained, squeezed dry, and sliced thinly

2 salted duck eggs (cooked or uncooked)

3 ounces Chinese bacon (lap yuk), sliced thinly

2 Chinese sausages (lap cheong), sliced thinly on the bias","Place sticky rice in a large bowl and cover completely with water. Let stand for at least 2 hours or overnight.

For the Marinated Chicken: In a medium bowl, mix chicken with the remaining marinade ingredients until thoroughly combined. Let stand in refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.

For the Sticky Rice Seasoning: Stir together all ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

For the Lotus Leaf Packages: Cut each lotus leaf in half down the middle. Place leaves in a large container, cover with water, weighing leaves down with a plate if necessary, and soak for 1 hour.

Drain sticky rice well and transfer to a large bowl. Stir in dried shrimp, if using.

In a non-stick skillet or wok, heat 2 teaspoons of oil over high heat until shimmering. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Scrape mixture into the sticky rice and stir to combine. Stir in the Sticky Rice Seasoning.

In the same skillet or wok, heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil over high heat until shimmering. Add marinated chicken, and cook, stirring, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.

If you are using cooked salted duck eggs, peel the eggs, then slice in half and gently scoop out yolks with a spoon (it’s ok if some of the egg whites are attached). If you are using raw salted duck eggs, crack the eggs into a small bowl and separate the whites from the yolks (the yolks should be bright orange and fairly firm); carefully slice the yolks in half with a knife. Set cooked or uncooked yolks aside on a small plate.

To form packages, drain lotus leaves, pat dry with towels, and arrange on a work surface. Alternatively, arrange 4 pieces parchment paper on work surface.

Place about 1/2 cup of sticky rice mixture in the center of each lotus leaf.

Arrange cooked chicken, Chinese bacon, Chinese sausage, and salted duck yolks on top of each stick rice mound.

Scoop another 1/2 cup of sticky rice mixture directly on top of the rice mounds on each lotus leaf, carefully spreading it out to cover the meats and egg yolk; it's okay if the rice can’t cover everything.

Wrap each lotus-leaf or parchment package by folding edges around filling to form a tight package. Using kitchen twine, tie up each package.

Bring water to a boil in a steamer setup. Arrange rice packages in steamer and steam for 1 hour 30 minutes; make sure to check water level occasionally, topping up with more boiling water if needed to prevent it from going dry.

Cut off and discard kitchen twine and serve right away.","Chinese,Chicken Thighs,White Rice,Shiitake Mushroom,Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/sticky-rice-wrapped-lotus-leaf-lo-mai-gai-recipe
Pan-Fried Leek Buns (Shui Jian Bao) Recipe,Cathy Erway,Chinese Cuisine,"For the Crust:

1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

1/4 teaspoon salt

1 tablespoon vegetable or peanut oil

1/3 cup water

For the Filling:

1 tablespoon dried baby shrimp

4 to 6 large leeks, white and light green parts only, or 1 large bunch whole Chinese chives or leeks

2 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil

1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste

1/4 pound dried mung bean starch noodles (bean thread noodles)

1 teaspoon sesame oil

1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, plus more to taste

To Cook:

2 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil

1/2 cup water","For the Crust: Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the oil and enough of the water so that the dough just comes together in a ball. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until the surface is smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. Cover with plastic and set aside to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.

For the Filling: In a small bowl, soak the dried shrimp in about [1/4] cup water for at least 5 minutes, until slightly softened. Drain and chop finely. Finely chop the leeks.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the soaked shrimp and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the leeks along with the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and the juices have mostly evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. You should have about 1 cup of the leek mixture.

Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain well. Once cool enough to handle, transfer to a cutting board and coarsely chop. You should have about 1 cup chopped noodles.

In a bowl, combine the cooked leek mixture and the noodles. Stir in the sesame oil and white pepper and taste for seasoning, adding extra salt and white pepper as desired.

To form the buns, divide the dough into 8 equal-sized pieces. Roll out each one on a slightly floured surface to a round about 4 inches in diameter. Place about 1 tablespoon filling in the center of each round. Carefully bring the edges of the dough to the center of the bun to seal it shut over the filling. Make sure there are no gaps or holes. Place the buns sealed-side down on a lightly floured surface as each one is finished.

To Cook: Heat the oil in a large skillet with a tight fitting lid over medium-high heat. Once hot, arrange as many buns as will fit in a single layer in the pan so that the bottoms retain full contact with the pan (you may need to work in batches). Cook until the bottoms are just golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water and immediately cover the pan. Steam until the dough on the tops of the buns has turned translucent rather than opaque white, about 8 minutes. If there is still liquid remaining in the pan, uncover and continue to cook until it evaporates and buns are crisp. Serve immediately.","Snacks & Appetizers,East Asian,Stovetop,Leeks",https://www.seriouseats.com/pan-fried-taiwanese-leek-buns-shui-jian-bao

Andrea Nguyen's Spicy-Sweet Fried Tofu Buns,Caroline Russock,Chinese Cuisine,"14 to 16 ounces firm tofu

2 cups very hot or just-boiled water

1/2 cup Thai Sweet Chile Sauce (recipe follows)

1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon light (regular) soy sauce

2 tablespoons unsalted roasted peanuts, chopped

1 1/2 teaspoons dark brown sugar

12 Chinese folded buns, fresh or thawed

Canola oil for deep-frying

About 1/3 cup potato starch

1 generous tablespoon chopped cilantro, leafy tops only

Thai Sweet Chile Sauce

1/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro stems

2 cups water

3 to 4 tablespoons coarsely chopped garlic

4 ounces medium-hot red chiles, such as Fresno, mostly seeded (according to taste) and coarsely chopped

1/8 teaspoon salt

About 1 3/4 cups distilled white vinegar

1 1/3 cups sugar","For the Chile Sauce: Put the cilantro stems and water into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover. Let steep for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, use a small food processor to grind the garlic, chiles, and salt to a coarse texture. Set aside.

Strain the cilantro liquid through a mesh strainer. Measure the liquid. You should have about 1 3/4 cups. Transfer to a saucepan, preferably a shallow, wide one. Pour in the same quantity of vinegar as you have of cilantro liquid. Stir in the sugar and mixture of chile and garlic.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat and simmer until the volume has reduced by half; the amount of time this takes depends on the size of your saucepan. The resulting sauce should be slightly thick. Coat the back of a spoon and run your finger through it; the line should hold for only a few seconds. The sauce will thicken more and concentrate in flavor during cooling.


Remove from the heat and set aside, uncovered, to cool completely. Use immediately or transfer to a jar and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.

For the Buns: Cut the tofu crosswise into 2 blocks, then cut each block crosswise into 6 chunky matchbooks, each about 1 1/2 inches by 2 inches by 1/2 inch. Put all 12 pieces of tofu in a bowl. Dissolve 1 1/2 of teaspoons salt in the hot water, then pour over the tofu to cover. Set aside for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the Thai sweet chile sauce with the soy sauce. Reserve 2 to 3 tablespoons of it in a saucer or small dish that you can later dunk the tofu into. Set aside.


In a small food processor, grind the peanuts, brown sugar, and a pinch of salt to the texture of coarse cornmeal. (Or, use a mortar and pestle.) Transfer to a small bowl and set near the sauce.

Before frying the tofu, bring a pot of water to a boil to reheat the buns. Line 2 steamer trays with parchment paper and add the buns. Steam the buns over gently boiling water until soft, fluffy, and hot to the touch, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat but keep the lid on to ensure that the buns remain soft and warm.

Pour off the water from the tofu, then transfer the pieces to a non-terry dishtowel or double layer of paper towels placed atop a plate. Let drain for about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat 1 inch of oil in a wok or saucepan over high heat to between 360° and 370°F. As the oil heats up, blot excess moisture from the tofu. Because the starch can turn gummy if it sits too long on the tofu, wait until the oil temperature approaches 340°F before dredging each piece of tofu in the potato starch to coat well. Shake off excess starch, then set aside on a plate near the stove.


When the oil is ready, fry the tofu in 2 or 3 batches, sliding the pieces into the oil, then gently stirring with chopsticks or a skimmer to fry evenly and prevent them from sticking. They should be very crisp after 2 to 3 minutes. It’s okay if they get just slightly golden. Drain the fried tofu on a paper towel. Return the oil to temperature before frying another batch.

For each bun, press one side of a piece of tofu into the saucer of sweet chile sauce, then put the tofu into the bun, sauced side down. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of sauce on top of the tofu, then add a sprinkling of cilantro, then about 3/4 teaspoon of peanuts.


Serve the buns immediately, while the tofu is still warm and chewy-crisp. Let guests add extra sauce to their buns as they wish.","Tofu,East Asian,Vegetarian,Fried Tofu,Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/andrea-nguyens-spicy-sweet-fried-tofu-buns

Rich and Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen Broth Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,Chinese Cuisine,"3 pounds pig trotters, split lengthwise or cut crosswise into 1-inch disks (ask your butcher to do this for you)

2 pounds chicken backs and carcasses, skin and excess fat removed

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 large onion, skin on, roughly chopped

12 garlic cloves

One 3-inch knob ginger, roughly chopped

2 whole leeks, washed and roughly chopped

2 dozen scallions, white parts only (reserve greens and light green parts for garnishing finished soup)

6 ounces whole mushrooms or mushroom scraps

1 pound slab pork fat back","Place pork and chicken bones in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Place on a burner over high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat as soon as boil is reached.

While pot is heating, heat vegetable oil in a medium cast iron or non-stick skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook, tossing occasionally until deeply charred on most sides, about 15 minutes total. Set aside.

Once pot has come to a boil, dump water down the drain. Carefully wash all bones under cold running water, removing any bits of dark marrow or coagulated blood. Bones should be uniform grey/white after you've scrubbed them. Use a chopstick to help remove small bits of dark marrow from inside the trotters or near the chicken's spines.

Return bones to pot along with charred vegetables, leeks, scallion whites, mushrooms, and pork fatback. Top up with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, skimming off any scum that appears (this should stop appearing within the first 20 minutes or so). Use a clean sponge or moist paper towels to wipe and black or gray scum off from around the rim of the pot. Reduce heat to a bare simmer and place a heavy lid on top.

Once the lid is on, check the pot after 15 minutes. It should be at a slow rolling boil. If not, increase or decrease heat slightly to adjust boiling speed. Boil broth until pork fatback is completely tender, about 4 hours. Carefully remove pork fat with a slotted spatula. Transfer fatback to a sealed container and refrigerate until step 7. Return lid to pot and continue cooking until broth is opaque with the texture of light cream, about 6 to 8 hours longer, topping up as necessary to keep bones submerged at all times. If you must leave the pot unattended for an extended period of time, top up the pot and reduce the heat to the lowest setting while you are gone. Return to a boil when you come back and continue cooking, topping up with more water as necessary.

Once broth is ready, cook over high heat until reduced to around 3 quarts. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean pot. Discard solids. For an even cleaner soup, strain again through a chinois or a fine mesh strainer lined with several layers of cheese cloth. Skim liquid fat from top with a ladle and discard.

Finely chop cooked pork fatback and whisk into finished broth. To serve, season broth with condiments of your choice (salt, soy sauce, miso, sesame paste, grated fresh garlic, chili oil or a mixture of all, for instance) and serve with cooked ramen noodles and toppings as desired.","Ramen,Japanese,Stovetop,Pork,Soups",https://www.seriouseats.com/rich-and-creamy-tonkotsu-ramen-broth-from-scratch-recipe

1/4 cup (50g) sugar

6 scallions, roughly chopped

6 whole garlic cloves

One 2-inch knob ginger, unpeeled, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick pieces

1 large shallot, unpeeled, halved

2-pound (900g), skin-on slab of boneless pork belly

Kosher salt","In small saucepan, bring sake to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until reduced by half and alcohol has cooked off, about 5 minutes. Transfer reduced sake to pressure cooker pot along with mirin, soy sauce, sugar, scallions, garlic, ginger, and shallot. Set aside.

Lay pork belly on cutting board and roll up tightly lengthwise, with skin facing out.

Using butchers twine, tightly secure pork belly at 3/4-inch intervals.

Add pork belly to pressure cooker pot (it won't be submerged). If using an electric pressure cooker, cover and seal the pot, set the pressure cooker to ""high pressure"" and set the cook time to 1 hour and 30 minutes. If using a stovetop pressure cooker, cover and seal the pot, set it over medium-high heat, and allow to come to pressure. Cook at high pressure for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally, or manually release pressure. Pork belly should be fully tender, offering little resistance when poked with a cake tester or paring knife at its center.

Using a spatula and tongs, carefully transfer pork (it will be very soft) to a large container. Strain cooking liquid through fine-mesh strainer into container with pork. Cool at room temperature, then cover container tightly and refrigerate until pork is completely chilled, at least 6 hours.

When ready to serve, remove pork belly from container, wiping off excess cooking liquid; reserve cooking liquid for another use (like making ajitsuke tamago or braising more pork in the future). Slice pork belly crosswise 1/4-inch-thick pieces, removing and discarding twine as you go (if you are not serving all of the pork at once, do not remove all of the twine, as it helps hold the shape of the chashu and makes it easier to slice).

To Serve: Pork belly slices can be seasoned with salt to taste and placed directly on top of a bowl of piping hot ramen. Alternatively, slices can be torched or broiled before serving.

If using a broiler, set rack 2 to 3 inches from broiler element, and preheat broiler on high. Place pork belly slices on rimmed baking sheet and broil until slices are warmed through, fat is bubbling, and some light charring occurs, 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the strength of the broiler. Season pork belly slices with salt to taste. Place atop piping hot bowls of ramen.

If using a kitchen torch, place pork belly slices on rimmed baking sheet. Turn torch on, making sure the flame is blue (which indicates full combustion of the gas), then direct the flame at the surface of the meat, holding torch 4 to 5 inches above meat. Cook until fat is bubbling, some light charring occurs, and meat is warmed through, about 30 seconds. Season pork belly slices with salt to taste.

14 ounces (2 cups; 400g) sugar

1 tablespoon (15ml) lemon juice

1 pinch (15 strands) saffron

4 green cardamom pods, crushed

2 whole cloves

1 teaspoon (5ml) rose water

For the Jamuns:

1.4 ounces (1/4 cup; 40g) fine semolina flour (see note)

1/4 cup (60ml) milk

5.3 ounces (2 cups; 150g) non-fat dried milk powder (see note)

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 teaspoon ground green cardamom

1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume

6 tablespoons (90ml) heavy cream, divided plus more as needed

3 cups (720ml) grapeseed oil, for frying (see note)

3 tablespoons (25g) chopped pistachios or cashews, for garnish (optional)","For the Syrup: Combine water, sugar, lemon juice, saffron, cardamom, and cloves in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until a drop of the syrup pressed between two teaspoons forms a sticky, thin thread when spoons are pulled apart, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in rose water, cover, and set aside to keep warm.

For the Jamuns: In a small bowl, stir together semolina and milk, and set aside for 30 minutes to allow semolina to soak. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together milk powder, baking powder, cardamom, and salt. Sift mixture twice through a fine-mesh strainer onto prepared baking sheet, using clean hands or a bowl scraper to break up any lumps or bits that might be left behind in the strainer basket.

Transfer sifted mixture back to large bowl, and make a small well in the center; return sheet of parchment to baking sheet, and set aside. Add the semolina-milk mixture along with 1/4 cup (60ml) cream to center of well and, using clean hands, mix ingredients to form stiff but sticky dough. If mixture seems dry, add more cream as needed, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until dough forms. When mixing, try not to aggressively knead the dough, as the gulab jamuns will become quite dense; instead, press the ingredients gently together with your fingertips to form dough.

To form jamuns, take 1 tablespoon of dough and roll between palms to shape into a smooth, 1-inch (2.5 cm) ball. The dough will appear sticky at first, but the heat from your palms will help soften it and make it more pliable. If any cracks appear on the surface, wet your palm with a drop or two of heavy cream to help shape and smooth out ball. Place formed jamun on the reserved parchment-lined baking sheet, and repeat forming process with remaining dough (you should end up with 18 balls).

In a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, heat ghee or oil over medium-high heat to 325°F (160°C). Line a plate with paper towels. Working in two batches, carefully add half of the dough balls, one at a time, to the hot oil; using a slotted spoon, immediately move each ball as it's added to the oil to prevent them from sticking to bottom of the pot. Cook, occasionally moving balls around with a slotted spoon to ensure even cooking, until jamuns are golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel-lined plate, and allow to rest 30 seconds. Transfer fried jamuns to saucepan of scented syrup, and cover. Repeat process with remaining dough balls.

Let jamuns soak in the syrup, covered, for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. (After the initial 4-hour soak, the gulab jamuns can be transferred along with the syrup to the refrigerator.) To serve, gently reheat gulab jamuns in the syrup over low heat until warmed through. Transfer to a platter or individual serving plates, spooning syrup generously over top, and garnish with chopped pistachios or cashews, if using. Serve immediately.","Indian,Stovetop,Desserts",https://www.seriouseats.com/gulab-jamun

1 teaspoon black peppercorns

1/2 teaspoon whole cloves

12 to 15 dried red cayenne chiles (like chiles de arbol), stems discarded

1 teaspoon ground turmeric

&nbsp

Curry

2 tablespoons canola oil

1 small onion, coarsely chopped

4 medium-size cloves garlic, coarsely chopped

4 pieces fresh ginger (each about the size and thickness of a 25-cent coin; no need to peel the skin), coarsely chopped

2 teaspoons Raghavan’s Blend (above) or store-bought Madras curry powder

1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes with their juices

1/2 cup half-and-half

1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 2-inch cubes

1 teaspoon coarse kosher or sea salt

2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems","To make the spice blend: Place the coriander, cumin, mustard seeds, peppercorns, cloves, and chiles in a spice grinder (you can also use a coffee grinder) and grind them to the consistency of finely ground black pepper. Stir in the turmeric, which will yellow the spice blend with its characteristic sunny bright disposition. Store the spice blend in a tightly sealed container, away from excess light, heat, and humidity, for up to 3 months.

To make the curry: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil appears to shimmer, add the onion, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry until the onion is light caramel brown around the edges, 4 to 5 minutes.

Sprinkle the spice blend into the skillet and stir to mix. Let the spices roast in the onion medley until the aromas dramatically change, 10 seconds. Pour in the tomatoes and stir once or twice. Lower the heat and simmer the chunky sauce, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tomato pieces soften, the excess moisture evaporates, and some of the oils in the spices start to dot the edge of the sauce, 5 to 7 minutes.

Pour the half-and-half into the skillet and scrape the bottom once or twice to release any bits of onion, garlic, and ginger, effectively deglazing the skillet and releasing those flavors back into the sauce. Transfer the chunky curry to a blender. Holding the lid down, puree the curry until it is slightly curdled looking but smooth, and saffron orange-hued.

Return the sauce to the skillet and stir in the chicken and salt. Simmer the curry, covered, over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the chicken, when cut with a fork or knife, is cooked through, no longer pinkish-red, and its juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes.

Sprinkle the cilantro on top of the chicken curry and serve.","Curries,Indian,Stovetop Chicken,Chicken",https://www.seriouseats.com/raghavan-iyer-ultimate-chicken-curry-from-indian-cooking-unfolded

Savory Chiroti Recipe,Chetna Makan,Indian,"For the Dough:

1 1/4 cups plus 3 1/2 tablespoons (210g) all-purpose flour

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon (100g) fine semolina flour

1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume or an equivalent weight

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons ghee

1/2 cup (120ml) water

For the Paste:

2 tablespoons ghee, melted

3 tablespoons (30g) rice flour

Sunflower oil or other neutral oil, such as canola or peanut, for deep-frying","Start the Dough: In a medium mixing bowl, thoroughly whisk together all-purpose flour, semolina flour, salt, and pepper. Add ghee to bowl and, using your hand, rub it into dry ingredients until well incorporated. Slowly drizzle in water, while mixing with your hand, until a firm yet supple dough forms; add the water slowly and make sure to mix it well as you go, as you may need slightly more or less water to reach the desired dough consistency. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest at room temperature for 1 hour.

Make the Paste: In a small mixing bowl, stir together liquid ghee and rice flour to form a paste.

Form the Chiroti: Once dough has rested, divide it into 2 equal portions. Transfer one portion to a work surface and keep the other covered with plastic to prevent drying.

Using your hands, roll the dough into a uniform log shape, then divide it into 5 equal portions, each weighing about 1.7 ounces (50g).

Using your hands, form each piece of dough into a ball. Using a rolling pin, and working with one piece at a time, roll each dough portion into a thin circle, flipping and rotating the dough 90 degrees between rolls, until it is about 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18cm) in diameter. Keep the rolled dough portions covered with a kitchen towel to prevent drying.

Once all 5 small dough balls have been rolled into thin circles, set one circle on a work surface. Using a pastry brush, brush dough circle all over with the paste. Set another dough circle directly on top of the first one and brush it with the paste. Continue until you have a stack of all 5 dough circles, each brushed with the paste.

Roll the stack of dough rounds tightly, like a jelly roll. Using a sharp knife, cut the roll into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Using a rolling pin, roll each of the pieces out into oval whorls about 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10cm) long.

Repeat steps 4 through 7 with the second portion of dough.

Fry the Chiroti: In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 inches oil to 365°F (185°C) over medium to low heat. Carefully add a few whorls of dough to the oil, making sure not to crowd the pot; each whorl should have enough space to float without overlapping any others. Fry, turning once or twice, until golden and crisp on both sides, about 4 minutes.

Aloo Paratha With Spiced Potato Filling Recipe,Nik Sharma,Indian,"For the Paratha Dough:

2 cups (11 1/4 ounces; 320g) atta, or a combination of 1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces; 210g) all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal Blue Label, and 1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces; 70g) whole wheat flour

1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight

2 tablespoons (30ml) neutral cooking oil, such as grapeseed or canola, or melted ghee

1 cup water (240ml), warmed to 160°F (70°C)

For the Filling:

4 medium Russet potatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds; 800g), peeled and cut into 1-inch (5-cm) chunks

1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight

1 shallot (60g), peeled and minced

One 1-inch (2.5cm) piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks

2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems

1 fresh green chile, such as Serrano, minced

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1 teaspoon ground coriander

1 teaspoon smoked paprika

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne

To Assemble and Cook:

Neutral cooking oil, such as grapeseed or canola, or melted ghee, for brushing dough rounds and cooking parathas (about 1/2 cup; 120ml)","For the Paratha Dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine atta (or, alternatively, all-purpose flour and wheat flour) and salt and whisk until thoroughly mixed, about 30 seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the dry ingredients and, using clean fingers, massage oil into dough to achieve a crumbly texture, about 1 minute.

Set bowl in stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. With the mixer at the lowest speed, slowly add water 1 to 2 tablespoons (15-30ml) at a time, until dough starts to come together; you may need to use the entire amount of water. Turn off stand mixer. Remove paddle attachment and, using a bowl scraper or flexible spatula, scrape down bowl and paddle attachment.

Attach the dough hook and set mixer to low speed, allowing machine to knead dough until it becomes soft and pliable; for atta-based dough, about 10 minutes; for dough with all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a clean, dry, lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for 1 minute, then shape it into a large ball. Wrap dough tightly with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and store it in an airtight container for 30 minutes before proceeding to Step 5.

For the Filling: In a large saucepan, combine potatoes and salt, cover with cold water, and bring to rolling boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook until potatoes are tender but not falling apart, and a paring knife inserted into a potato chunk experiences little resistance, about 8 minutes. Drain potatoes thoroughly, then transfer to a large mixing bowl or large plate and allow to cool to room temperature. Using a fork, mash the potatoes roughly (the final texture should be slightly flaky), then fold in shallot, ginger, cilantro, green chile, cumin, coriander, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne. Season with salt; it should be slightly saltier than you'd like, as it will be stuffed into the bread.

To Assemble and Cook the Parathas: Line a baking sheet or large tray with a clean lint-free kitchen towel (cotton is best) that’s been dusted with a little flour. Prepare a second kitchen towel similarly and place it over the first towel on the sheet. This setup will be used to hold the formed parathas.

On a lightly flour a work surface, divide the rested dough into 8 equal portions, forming each into an even ball. Working with one piece of dough at a time and keeping the rest covered with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel to prevent drying out, use a rolling pin to roll dough out into a 6-inch (15cm) round; use as little flour as possible to prevent sticking. Brush surface of dough circle with 1/2 teaspoon oil or ghee. Place 3 to 4 generous tablespoons of spiced potato filling in center of circle. Wrap the filling up by grabbing the outer sides of the circle, folding them over top, and pressing gently to form a flat disc. Alternatively, you can pinch the folds together as you would a dumpling, and then press them down into a circular disc. Roll disc out once more to form a 6-inch (15cm) circle, dusting disc, work surface, and rolling pin with as little flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking. Place paratha between the two prepared kitchen towels on baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining dough and filling.

To Cook the Parathas: Line a plate with clean kitchen towel. In a 10-inch stainless-steel or cast iron skillet, heat 1/2 teaspoon oil or ghee over medium-low heat. Using teaspoon or small spoon, spread an additional 1/2 teaspoon of oil or ghee over one side of paratha and place it in the hot skillet, greased side down. Cook until base starts to turn golden brown and develops light brown blisters, about 5 minutes. Spread 1/2 teaspoon oil or ghee on uncooked side, then, using spatula, carefully flip paratha and cook on second side until bottom starts to turn golden brown and develops blisters, about 5 minutes. If parathas develop blisters or brown too quickly, reduce heat. Transfer cooked paratha to towel-lined plate and cover. Carefully wipe pan down with clean, wadded paper towel or kitchen towel to remove any flour remaining in pan, which can burn. Repeat with remaining parathas. Serve immediately.","Indian,Bread,Russet Potatoes,Sides",https://www.seriouseats.com/aloo-paratha
Dosa (Indian Rice-and-Lentil Crepes) Recipe,Sohla El-Waylly,Indian,"2 cups long-grain white rice (14 ounces; 400g); see note

2/3 cup (4.8 ounces; 135g) urad dal (split husked black gram, a type of lentil)

1/2 teaspoon (3g) fenugreek

1/4 teaspoon (1.5g) baking soda

1 teaspoon (4g) kosher salt (not iodized)

Neutral oil, for cooking (optional)

Ghee, for drizzling","Soaking the Rice and Dal: In a small bowl, combine rice with 4 cups (960ml) distilled or bottled water and set aside to soak, at least 4 hours and no more than 12. In another small bowl, combine dal and fenugreek with 2 cups (480ml) distilled or bottled water and set aside to soak, at least 4 hours and no more than 12.

If Blending the Rice and Dal in a High-Powered Blender (Such as a Vitamix): Drain rice and discard its water. Drain dal and reserve its water. In the jar of a high-powered blender, combine soaked rice, soaked dal/fenugreek, and 1/2 cup (120ml) reserved dal-soaking water. Blend until completely smooth, adding more soaking water only as necessary to get a completely smooth texture. Transfer batter to a medium bowl.

If Blending the Rice and Dal in a Wet Grinder or Standard Blender: Drain rice and discard its water. Drain dal and reserve its water. In the jar of a standard blender or the bowl of a wet grinder, add drained rice, along with 1/4 cup (60ml) reserved dal-soaking water. Blend until completely smooth, adding more soaking water if needed to get a completely smooth texture. Pour rice batter into a medium bowl. Repeat with soaked dal and an additional 1/4 cup (60ml) dal-soaking water. Add dal batter to rice batter and stir until fully combined.

Adjusting the Batter's Thickness: Combine rice-and-dal purée with baking soda and kosher salt. If needed, thin purée with reserved dal-soaking water until it is just thinner than pancake batter. The final yield of the batter should be about 5 cups (1.2L).

To Ferment the Batter Without Special Equipment: Cover bowl of batter with a moist kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Put bowl in a warm place, such as near a radiator or in an oven with the pilot light on. Ferment until batter has doubled in volume; this can take anywhere from 8 to 24 hours. After batter has doubled, stir it with a wooden spoon to release the gases and allow it to double in size once more, an additional 8 to 24 hours. Once fermented, the batter can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 10 days or frozen for 3 months.

To Ferment the Batter With an Immersion Circulator: Set up a water bath with an immersion circulator and set the circulator to 110°F (43°C). Transfer batter to one or more glass jars, metal bain-maries, or metal hotel pans, filling each up no more than 1/3 full to give the batter room to rise (the number of containers you'll need will depend on their size). Lightly cover with plastic wrap and set in water bath. Allow batter to ferment until doubled in size, about 6 hours. (The time the batter takes to ferment can vary depending on the vessel it is fermenting in and the amount of batter in each vessel, so let 6 hours be a rough guide.) Once it has doubled, remove from bath and stir batter with a wooden spoon to release the gases. Cover and return to bath to double in size once more, about 6 hours longer. Once fermented, the batter can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 10 days or frozen for 3 months.

To Ferment the Batter With a Multi-Cooker (Such as an Instant Pot): Fill the insert of your multi-cooker 1/3 of the way full with batter. Cover and select the yogurt setting for 6 hours. After the yogurt cycle is complete, the batter should have doubled in size. Uncover multi-cooker and stir batter to release the built-up gases. Repeat another cycle of the yogurt setting to allow the batter to double in size once more. Once fermented, the batter can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 10 days or frozen for 3 months.

Cooking the Dosa: Preheat a 10-inch cast iron griddle over medium heat. (If your griddle is well seasoned, then no cooking oil will be necessary; if it's not, add 1 teaspoon/5ml neutral oil to the griddle once it's preheated.) Using a 1/4-cup measure or 2-ounce ladle, pour batter onto center of griddle. Using the bottom of the measuring cup or ladle, spread batter, using circular motions, until it thinly covers the entire griddle bottom. Cook until the surface of the dosa is just set, about 1 minute. Brush or drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) melted ghee. Continue cooking until bottom of dosa is golden brown and edges are crisp, about 4 minutes longer. Serve right away. Repeat with remaining batter until all dosa are cooked.","Gluten-free,Indian,Stovetop,Lentils,Rice & Grains",https://www.seriouseats.com/dosa-indian-rice-and-lentil-crepes

Shankarpali (Shakarpara) Recipe,Chetna Makan,Indian,"2 1/4 cups (340g) all-purpose flour

3/4 cup (100g) powdered sugar

1 teaspoon cardamom powder

1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume

1/4 cup plus 4 teaspoons (60g) ghee

1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk

Sunflower oil or other neutral oil, such as canola or peanut, for deep-frying","In a medium mixing bowl, thoroughly whisk together flour, sugar, cardamom, and salt. Add ghee and, using your hands, rub it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Slowly add milk in small increments, using your hands to mix it in until a firm yet supple dough forms (you may not need the entire 1/2 cup milk). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.

Place dough on a work surface and divide into 4 portions. Working with one portion at a time, and keeping the rest covered with plastic to prevent drying, use a rolling pin to roll out each portion into a sheet a little less than 1/8 inch thick (about 2 to 3mm). Using a knife, cut a crosshatch pattern across each sheet of dough to create small diamond shapes.

In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 inches oil to 365°F (185°C); when oil is hot enough, a test piece of dough should sizzle and float to the surface immediately upon being placed in the pot. Place several pieces of dough in the oil at a time and fry, flipping the pieces midway through, until both sides are a deep golden brown, about 2 minutes.

Home-Style Tamagoyaki (Japanese Rolled Omelette) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,Indian,"2 large eggs

1 1/2 tablespoons (20ml) homemade dashi or hondashi, or more or less as desired (see note)

1 teaspoon (5ml) usukuchi (light) soy sauce, plus more for drizzling

1 teaspoon (5ml) mirin

An oil-soaked paper towel, folded up into a small bundle, for greasing the pan

Grated daikon radish, for serving","In a small bowl and using chopsticks, beat eggs until well combined and no visible traces of whites remain. Beat in the cooled dashi, mirin, and soy sauce.

Preheat tamagoyaki pan over medium-high heat until you can feel moderate heat radiating off it when your hand is held an inch or two from the surface (you want it just hot enough that the eggs will gently bubble and sizzle when they hit the pan, but not so hot that they rapidly brown). Holding your greased paper towel between a pair of chopsticks, rub the pan all over with a light coating of oil, including in all the corners (it helps to store the oiled towel nearby in a small dish during the cooking process).

Add one-quarter of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan to spread the egg around in an even layer covering the bottom of the pan. Using your chopsticks, puncture any large bubbles that form.

When the egg has fully set on the bottom but is still slightly wet on top, begin your first roll: Lift the pan off the heat and try to slide one of your chopsticks under the far edge of the egg layer; then, with a quick upward motion of the pan, lift and roll the egg sheet up and over itself so that it rolls partway toward the handle. Repeat, rolling the egg sheet up fully toward the handle. This is the most difficult layer to roll because the egg sheet is so floppy; if you have trouble, don't worry, just use your chopsticks to push the egg sheet, bunching it up by the handle end.

Return the pan to the heat. Rub the oiled towel all over the exposed surface of the pan (this should be the middle and far side), then slide the omelette roll away from the handle to the far side of the pan and grease the area near the handle.

Add the next quarter of the egg mixture (you will make four layers in total), spreading it around the bottom of the pan. Using your chopsticks, lift the rolled portion up and let the raw egg run underneath it. Continue to cook, popping any large bubbles that form, until the new layer is just set and still wet on top.

Now repeat the rolling step as before, sliding a chopstick under the far edge and flopping the cooked egg log over itself as you roll it toward the handle. Repeat the layering and rolling process two more times until the egg is finished.

Turn the rolled tamagoyaki out onto a bamboo sushi mat, if desired, and roll it up tightly but gently (this helps set a uniform rolled shape, but isn't required); let stand 3 minutes. Transfer tamagoyaki to a serving plate, slice crosswise if desired, and serve with a small mound of grated daikon radish; lightly drizzle some extra usukuchi soy sauce on the daikon mound, if desired.

Jjajangmyeon (Korean Black Bean Noodles) Recipe,Seoyoung Jung,Indian,"1 cup (225ml) vegetable oil (only if you're stir-frying the black bean sauce; see note), plus more for stir-frying the meat and aromatics

One 8-ounce (225g) jar black bean sauce (see note)

6 large shell-on shrimp (3 1/2 ounces; 100g)

6 ounces (170g) boneless, skinless pork belly, cut into 1/4-inch dice

2 scallions, white and light-green parts only, cut into 1/4-inch dice

1 tablespoon (15ml) oyster sauce, plus more to taste

1 1/2 teaspoons (8g) sugar

Freshly ground black pepper

1 teaspoon potato starch mixed with 2 teaspoons (10ml) water

Enough jjajangmyeon noodles for 4 servings

Julienned cucumber, cooked green peas, or thinly sliced scallions, for garnish","If Stir-Frying the Black Bean Sauce (see note): Add oil to a wok and heat over high heat until oil reaches 350°F (180°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Set the wok's spatula in the oil as it heats so that the spatula is heated as well; this will help prevent the black bean sauce from sticking to the spatula when it's added.

Add black bean sauce and fry, stirring constantly, until black bean sauce begins to look just slightly curdled. Immediately transfer to a heatproof container, along with all the frying oil. It's better to err on the side of less frying if you're unsure, as over-fried black bean sauce will clump up and be difficult to work with later.

To Make the Jjajangmyeon: In a small saucepan of simmering water, poach shrimp until just pink on the outside and still undercooked in the center, about 30 seconds. Drain. Shell shrimp and cut into 1/4-inch dice.

In a clean wok, heat about 3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil over high heat until smoking. (You can use some of the vegetable oil from the bean-frying step, if you stir-fried the beans.) Add pork belly and spread in an even layer. Allow to sear for 30 seconds, then begin stirring and tossing constantly until pork is browned all over, about 30 seconds longer. (If you're working over gas, you may get some flare-ups; they'll die down quickly and enhance the flavor of the stir-fry.)

Add scallion, ginger, and about 3 tablespoons diced onion, then cook, stirring and tossing, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add soy sauce, pouring it down the side of the wok to make it sizzle. Cook, stirring, for 10 seconds longer.

Add potato and squid and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until potato is about half cooked, about 3 minutes. Add remaining onion and cook, stirring and tossing, until onion has softened, about 1 minute. Working in 1-tablespoon (15ml) additions, add black bean sauce (without too much of the oil it was fried with), tossing to coat all the ingredients; exactly how much you add will depend on your taste, but your goal is a rich black bean character and very dark brown color throughout. (We ended up adding about 5 heaping tablespoons of the black bean sauce we used.)

Add shrimp and toss to combine. Add oyster sauce and sugar and stir well to incorporate. Season with black pepper. Add water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until the mixture has thinned enough to create a thick but flowing sauce. Continue cooking until potato is just cooked through; stir often and lower heat as needed to prevent scorching.

Add more water as needed, roughly 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, to reach a saucy consistency; if sauce becomes too thin, add 1 teaspoon (5ml) potato-starch slurry and bring to a simmer to help thicken the liquid. Repeat this process, adjusting with small amounts of water and slurry as needed, until the sauce is glossy and thick but slowly pourable. Adjust seasoning with more oyster sauce or soy sauce as desired.

Meanwhile, boil jjajangmyeon noodles following the manufacturer's instructions. Drain and portion into serving bowls. Spoon the jjajangmyeon sauce on top, garnish with cucumbers, peas, or scallions, and serve.","Korean,Black Beans,Noodles,Pork Belly,Squid",https://www.seriouseats.com/jjajangmyeon-black-bean-noodles

28g (1 ounce; 1/2 cup) nutritional yeast (see note)

4g (1 teaspoon) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight

285g (10 ounces; 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons) cool water

1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil","In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the flour, nutritional yeast, and salt together to combine. With processor running, add water and oil and process until dough forms and runs around processor blade, about 30 seconds.

Transfer dough to clean counter. Knead dough until smooth. Roll, knead, and stretch dough, doubling back after each stretch, until dough begins to stretch without tearing, 3 to 5 minutes.

Stretch dough to arm’s-length, then bring ends together to twirl dough into even, twisted log (roll dough on counter after twisting to even out thicker areas). Repeat stretching and twirling until dough pulls full arm’s-length with no resistance and no tearing, about 10 minutes longer. Roll dough into an even log shape.

If you plan to pull and cook the noodles immediately, dust the counter liberally with flour and bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil over high heat. If you would like to practice the noodle-pulling technique, do not flour the counter and proceed with the pulling instructions. Flouring the noodles is a point of no return—once floured, they must be cooked. If the dough is not floured, you can practice the pulling technique over and over without harming the dough. Gently roll dough log in flour, then use a bench scraper to divide dough into 3 equal portions.

Working with one piece at a time, shape into 15-inch log. Holding log at both ends, stretch to about 30 inches in length. (The following instructions are written for right-handed people; invert them if you are left-handed.) Bring right end of dough to left hand, forming loop. Using free right hand, gently tug and pull dough from midpoint of loop in fluid motion to about 30 inches. Move dough through floured surface to keep from sticking.

Bring right end of dough to left hand and gently bunch dough ends together, forming another loop of 4 strands. Using free right hand, gently tug and pull dough from midpoint of loop in fluid motion to about 30 inches. Move dough through floured surface to keep from sticking. Repeat process 2 to 3 more times until noodles are about 1⁄8 inch in diameter.

Use bench scraper or knife to cut and separate noodles from small clump of dough in left hand. Immediately transfer portion of finished noodles to the pot of boiling water, and cook, stirring with tongs or chopsticks to prevent sticking, until noodles are cooked through but still chewy, 30 to 45 seconds. Drain noodles thoroughly using a fine-mesh strainer or noodle basket, shaking off as much excess water as possible, then transfer to a serving bowl with hot broth.

Repeat stretching, pulling, and cooking steps with remaining two portions of dough. A fourth portion of noodles can be pulled from excess dough scraps if desired. Knead, stretch, and twirl excess scraps of dough into even log, roll in flour, and repeat pulling process. Serve cooked noodles immediately.

2 fresh kaffir lime leaves

2 inches fresh ginger, peeled and sliced

1½ ounces palm sugar (1 round gula jawa) or 2 tablespoons light brown sugar

1 tablespoon kosher salt

One 5-pound watermelon

For the Dressing

3 ounces palm sugar (2 rounds gula jawa) or ¼ cup light brown sugar

1 cup rice vinegar

½ cup fresh lime juice

4 inches fresh ginger, peeled and sliced

6 fresh cilantro roots with 1 inch of stems, rinsed, scraped, and rinsed again, or 24 cilantro stems

2 garlic cloves, chopped

¾ teaspoon kosher salt

For the Pork

About 3 cups rendered leaf lard or neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola

2 pounds Braised Pork Belly (recipe follows), cut into 1-inch chunks while still cold

1 cup all-purpose flour

Sea salt

To finish the dish

1 cup fresh Vietnamese mint (rou ram) leaves

1 cup fresh Thai basil leaves

3 scallions, sliced

¼ cup sesame seeds

Braised Pork Belly

For the Brine

¼ cup coriander seeds

2 tablespoons fennel seeds

4 cups sea salt

2 cups sugar

10 garlic cloves, crushed and peeled

10 fresh long red chilies, such as Anaheim or Hungarian Wax, thinly sliced

5 medium shallots, sliced

3 tablespoons black peppercorns

1 cup packed daun salam (Indonesian bay leaves)

2 to 3 pounds fresh pork belly

For the Braise

2 tablespoons rendered leaf lard or olive oil (the best you can afford)

1 yellow onion, cut into sixths

1 head of garlic, halved crosswise

2 shallots, halved lengthwise

2 1/2 cups chicken stock","Brine the Pork Belly:Toast the coriander and fennel seeds in a dry pan over medium heat, swirling and shaking them until they crackle lightly and release their aroma, about 3 minutes.


Set aside.

Combine the toasted seeds with the salt, sugar, garlic, chilies, shallots, peppercorns, daun salam, and 3 gallons water in a stockpot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and allow the brine to simmer for about 20 minutes. Remove the brine from the heat and let it come to room temperature, then refrigerate it. When it’s completely cool, pour it over the belly and refrigerate, covered, for at least 24 and up to 48 hours.

Braise the Pork Belly: Preheat the oven to 225°F. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit your roasting pan.

Remove the belly from the brine, rinse with cold water, and pat dry. Set aside.

In the roasting pan straddling two burners over medium-high, heat the leaf lard until hot but not smoking. Add the onion, garlic, and shallots, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the stock to the pan and deglaze, scraping up any bits with a wooden spoon.

When the stock comes to a boil, add the belly to the roasting pan and remove it from the heat. Top the pan with the parchment paper and cover with a tight lid or foil.

Braise the belly in the oven until it is tender (when you press the tip of a pairing knife into it, there should be no resistance). Start checking it after 2. hours, though it could take up to 4 hours.

Remove the pan from the oven and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Using two big spatulas or your hands, transfer the belly from the pan to a large plate or sheet tray and let it cool to room temperature. Strain the braising liquid and reserve for future use. The liquid can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

Wrap the belly tightly in plastic wrap. Press it between two flat pans (such as sheet trays) and put a weight on the top (a few cans of tomatoes will do the trick). Refrigerate, pressed, for at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.

After the belly has been cooked and pressed, it’s ready for any of the following recipes or any other culinary purpose. It keeps in the fridge, wrapped tightly, for about 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 6 months. To use frozen belly in a recipe, thaw it completely in the fridge first. Also, I like to cut my belly into portions prior to freezing so I don’t have to thaw the whole megillah at once.

Make the Watermelon Salad: Combine everything for the salad except the watermelon in a small saucepan. Add 1 cup water, bring the liquid to a boil over medium heat, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.

Meanwhile, cut the rind from the watermelon flesh, reserving both the rind and the flesh. Use a sharp knife to pare away the outer, darker green skin, leaving the inner, whiter fleshy rind. Discard the darker green peel. Cut the white rind into 1⁄4-inch cubes and put them in a bowl. Strain the seasoned rice vinegar liquid over the diced rind. Let the mixture cool, then chill for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.

Cut the flesh of the watermelon into 1-inch pieces (discarding whatever seeds you can). Chill it until you’re ready to use it.

Make the Dressing: Roughly crush the palm sugar using a mortar and pestle or a plastic bag and a rolling pin. Pulse the sugar with the vinegar, lime juice, ginger, cilantro roots, garlic, and salt in a food processor until smooth and well combined.

Fry the Pork In a large, straight-sided sauté pan or wok, heat 3 inches of lard to 375°F (measured on a deep-frying thermometer).

Toss the cubed pork belly in the flour and shake off any excess. Working in batches, fry the pork belly until very crisp and a deep golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer the pork with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined tray to drain and season with salt. return the fat to 375°F between batches.

Finish the Salad: Tear the mint and basil leaves. In a mixing bowl, toss the pickled watermelon rind and the chilled watermelon flesh with the sliced scallions, mint, and basil. Add just enough dressing to coat. Divide the pork among the plates. Top with the salad and garnish each dish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Serve immediately.","Salads,South Asian,Watermelon,Pork Belly,Summer Salads",https://www.seriouseats.com/zakary-pelaccios-crispy-pork-and-watermelon-salad-fatty-crab

1 stick butter, melted","Combine flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk until combined. Add yogurt and knead with dough hook on low speed until dough comes together into a smooth ball. Dough should stick slightly to bottom of bowl as it kneads (add slightly more yogurt or milk as necessary). Continue to knead for 5 minutes. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature until roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Using a bench scraper or a knife, cut the dough into 12 even pieces.

1 tablespoon (12g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same by weight

2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) vegetable oil, or other neutral oil

16 tablespoons (8 ounces; 112g) softened ghee, divided","To Make the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and kosher salt until combined, about 1 minute. Add the oil and rub evenly into flour, about 5 minutes. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in 1 cup (240ml) of warm water. Roughly combine the flour and water with your fingers until just brought together, about 1 minute. Next, knead the dough until it forms a sticky ball, about 5 minutes. Leave the dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a moist towel. Set aside to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.

After the dough has rested, divide it into 8 equal portions. Work with one portion of dough at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with a moist towel or plastic wrap while not handling.

For the First Roll: On a clean surface, roll out the dough until as thin as possible, sprinkling flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking to the rolling pin. The final dimensions of the dough should be roughly 16 inches by 10 inches, and it should be paper thin and translucent.

Using a small offset spatula, dab 1 tablespoon (15g) of softened ghee across the surface of the rolled out dough. Sprinkle a pinch of flour over the ghee. Starting from the top, roll down the dough sheet until it is all coiled into one long snake. Coil each end of the dough log inward until they meet at the center, then fold the two coils onto each other and press together firmly. Set aside the coiled dough ball to rest covered for at least one hour at room temperature and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.

For the Final Roll: On a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin, roll each coiled dough ball into a circle about 8 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Lightly dust the paratha, rolling pin, and counter with flour as needed to prevent sticking, dusting off any excess flour at the end. Rotate the paratha after each roll to maintain an even shape. Cook the rolled out parathas right away, or store between layers of parchment and wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to three days.

Cooking the Parathas: Preheat a heavy gauge 10- or 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Working with one paratha at a time, cook it in the dry skillet until dusty and dry to the touch, about 3 minutes per side. (After this first cook, the parathas can be stacked between sheets of parchment, wrapped in plastic, and stored in the refrigerator for 1 week or freezer for 3 months and cooked from frozen as needed.)

Preheat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of ghee and cook 1 paratha at a time until golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute per side. Once cooked through, scrunch the paratha to release any built-up steam. Serve right away or hold warm wrapped in a kitchen towel and in a 250°F (121°C) oven for up to 1 hour.","Bread,South Asian,Vegetarian Sides,Stovetop,Sides",https://www.seriouseats.com/paratha-flaky-south-asian-flatbread

Kaju Katli Recipe,Chetna Makan,Indian,"2 cups (250g) whole raw cashew nuts

2 tablespoons (15g) whole-milk powder

1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder

10 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons (125g) granulated sugar

1/4 cup (60ml) water

Rounded 1/2 teaspoon ghee

Edible silver leaf or vark, optional","In a blender, grind cashews to a fine powder, taking care not to grind them so thoroughly that the nuts release their oil. Place cashew powder in a medium mixing bowl, then whisk in milk powder and cardamom.

In a 2-quart saucepan, heat sugar and water over medium-high heat until sugar has melted. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches 230°F (110°C) on a probe or candy thermometer, about 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can judge the doneness of the candy syrup by placing a drop of it on your thumb, making sure to let it cool enough first that you don't burn yourself. Allow the drop of syrup to cool to room temperature, then pinch it between your thumb and index finger and pull them apart; the syrup is done when a single strand stretches between your fingers without breaking. (This is called a ""one-string consistency"" in Indian candy-making terminology.)

Turn heat to low and add cashew mixture, stirring continuously with a heat-resistant flexible spatula. The mixture should pull away from the sides of the pan and form a loose ball. Add ghee and mix well for a few seconds, then remove pan from heat.

Place a sheet of parchment paper on a clean work surface and carefully scoop hot cashew dough on top. Set a second piece of parchment paper on top of the cashew dough. Knead the hot cashew dough through the paper for a few seconds to help bring it together. Using a rolling pin, roll cashew dough out into a single even sheet about 1/8 inch (3mm) thick. Remove top layer of parchment.

Let dough stand 1 minute. If desired, carefully lay edible silver leaf (silver vark) all over the dough. Then, using a sharp knife, cut dough into diamond-shaped pieces 1 to 1 1/2 inches (2.5 to 4cm) long.

1 packed cup mint leaves and stems (3/4 ounce; 20g)

12 whole black peppercorns

4 medium garlic cloves (1/2 ounce; 15g), peeled

2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) grated fresh ginger

1 small fresh green chile, such as Serrano or Thai chile

1 teaspoon ground turmeric

1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume

Neutral cooking spray oil, such as canola

Lemon or lime wedges, for serving

For the Pickled Nectarines:

2 teaspoons coriander seeds

1/4 cup (60ml) apple cider vinegar

2 tablespoons (30ml) honey

1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume

1 teaspoon red chile flakes, such as Urfa or Aleppo

2 ripe but firm yellow nectarines (about 15 ounces; 420g)

2 tablespoons picked thyme leaves and very tender stems","To Marinate the Chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, score the top side of the chicken thighs 2 or 3 times, then prick all over with a fork. Place the chicken in a baking dish, ziptop bag, or a food-safe storage container with a lid.

In a blender, combine yogurt, scallions, mint, peppercorns, garlic, ginger, chile, turmeric, and salt. Pulse until very smooth. Pour the yogurt mixture all over the chicken, then gently toss to coat well. Cover the container or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

To Pickle the Nectarines: Heat a small dry skillet over medium heat. Add the coriander seeds to the hot skillet and toast until the seeds become fragrant and start to darken slightly, about 1 minute. Transfer toasted coriander seeds to a mortar and pestle and crush to a coarse powder.

In a medium bowl, whisk the vinegar, honey, and salt until combined. Stir in the chile flakes and coriander powder.

"Papri Chaat (Indian Street Snack With Potato, Chickpeas, and Chutneys) Recipe",Sohla El-Waylly,Indian,"For the Papris:

2 cups (260g) atta flour (Indian wheat flour) or whole wheat flour

1 teaspoon (4g) baking powder

1 1/2 teaspoons (7g) kosher salt

1 teaspoon (5g) nigella seeds

1 tablespoon (12g) vegetable oil

1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) oil for frying, such as canola, peanut, or vegetable

For the Mint Chutney:

1 bunch (60g) cilantro

1 bunch (60g) mint

Juice from 1 lime (about 30ml)

1 medium (20g) serrano pepper, sliced

For the Tamarind Chutney:

4 medjool dates (40g), pitted

1/3 cup (85g) tamarind paste (not concentrate)

1/2 teaspoon (2g) ginger powder

1/4 teaspoon (1g) Kashmiri red chili powder (see note)

1/3 cup (100g) palm sugar or light brown sugar

For the Sev:

1 cup (115g) chickpea flour

1/2 teaspoon (2g) Kashmiri red chili powder (see note)

1/4 teaspoon (1g) freshly ground black pepper

To Assemble:

1 cup (about 250g) boiled, peeled, and cubed russet potato

1 can (434g) chickpeas, drained (or equivalent freshly cooked from dried)

Chaat Masala spice mixture, to taste

1 pint (450g) whole-milk yogurt

1 small onion, diced

Kosher salt","For the Papris: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and nigella seeds. Add warm water, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms (it should be the consistency of Play-Doh). Knead in the bowl until mixture comes together into a smooth dough, about 5 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let rest for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough until it is approximately 2 millimeters thick. (You can use the nigella seeds as your guide: The dough should be just barely thicker than the seeds themselves.) Using a fork, prick all over surface of dough. (Alternatively, if left un-pricked, the papris will puff up when fried, and can then be stuffed for sev puri chaat and panipuri.) Using a 1 1/2–inch round cookie cutter, cut rounds from dough and set aside on a floured surface. Any scraps can be gathered and re-rolled until you have no more dough left.

In a large pot, wok, or Dutch oven, heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Working in batches of 6 to 8 pieces, fry papris, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain onto a paper towel–lined sheet tray and season with salt while still warm. Reserve frying oil for sev (below), if making from scratch. The papris will stay crisp in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

For the Mint Chutney: Prepare an ice bath. In a pot of salted boiling water, blanch cilantro and mint until they turn bright green, about 20 seconds. Shock herbs in ice bath to stop the cooking, then drain well. Squeeze out any excess liquid from herbs.

Remove and discard the thick mint stems, then roughly chop herbs and remaining tender stems. In a blender, purée blanched herbs with lime juice, serrano pepper, and just enough cold water to bring the mixture together, taking care not to over-blend and heat up the chutney, which can lead to discoloration. Season with salt to taste. The chutney will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.

For the Tamarind Chutney: In a small saucepan, combine dates, tamarind paste, ginger powder, chili powder, and sugar and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes to soften the tamarind paste and dates. Using a blender, purée until smooth, then pass through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any fibrous bits. The chutney will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

For the Sev: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together chickpea flour, chili powder, black pepper, and enough water (1/3 cup to 1/2 cup) to form a mixture with the thickness of pancake batter. Add batter to a piping bag fitted with a number 2 plain round tip, or use a zipper-lock bag with one corner snipped off to create a small opening.

Using the same frying oil as for the papris, heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Pipe squiggles of batter into oil, like a funnel cake, and fry until bubbling ceases. Using a spider or strainer, lift fried sev and transfer to a paper towel–lined sheet tray to drain. Repeat with remaining sev batter. The sev will stay crisp in an airtight container for up to 1 month.

To Assemble: On a large serving plate, spread papris in a single even layer.

In a small bowl, toss potatoes and chickpeas with chaat masala to taste. Spread potatoes and chickpeas all over papris.

In a small bowl, combine yogurt with chaat masala to taste and spoon over potatoes, chickpeas, and papris.

Top with diced onion, mint and tamarind chutneys, and sev. Sprinkle more chaat masala on top and serve right away, preferably with sweet, milky black tea.","Snacks & Appetizers,Recipes By Ingredients,Indian,Chickpeas,Russet Potatoes",https://www.seriouseats.com/papri-chaat-indian-street-snack-recipe

1 cup plain, unsweetened full-fat yogurt

6 medium garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated

One 2–inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated

3 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided; if using table salt, use half as much by volume

1/4 cup (60 ml) plus 2 teaspoons (10ml) ghee or neutral oil, such as grapeseed, divided

2 large yellow or white onions (26 ounces; 750g total), sliced thinly

5 green cardamom pods, lightly cracked, divided

1 cinnamon stick

4 cloves

2 dried bay leaves

1 teaspoon garam masala, store-bought or homemade

1 teaspoon ground Kashmiri chili (see note)

1/4 cup (60ml) fresh lemon or lime juice

1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped

1 bunch fresh mint leaves, chopped

1 fresh green chile, such as a serrano or Thai bird, minced

1/4 cup (60ml) whole milk

20 strands of saffron, divided

2 teaspoons rosewater

2 teaspoons pandan (kewra/screwpine) water (see note)","Place the lamb in a 1 gallon (3.8L) ziptop bag. In a medium bowl, mix the yogurt, garlic, ginger, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt until combined, pour the yogurt mixture over the lamb, seal the bag, and shake the bag to coat the lamb well. Leave the ziptop bag in the refrigerator to marinate overnight.

Heat 1/4 cup (60ml) ghee or oil in a Dutch oven or saucepan with a heavy bottom over medium heat. Add the onions, season with a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions caramelize and turn dark brown (but not black), about 25 to 30 minutes.

Reduce the heat to low. Remove half of the caramelized onions and reserve to use as garnish for the biryani. Add 3 green cardamom pods, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, garam masala, Kashmiri chili, mace, and turmeric, and sauté just until spices become fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the lamb along with the yogurt marinade, the water or stock, and the cilantro, mint, and green chili. Stir to mix well, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover with lid, and cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lamb is completely tender.

Meanwhile, as the lamb cooks, prepare the rice. Pick over the the rice for any debris, then place it in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water, until the runoff is no longer cloudy; drain well. Place the rice in a bowl and cover with 4 cups (960ml) water and let stand for 30 minutes. Strain the rice, discarding soaking water. In a large saucepan, combine rice with 4 cups cold water, lemon juice, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, the remaining 2 green cardamom pods, and the remaining 2 teaspoons of ghee or oil and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 2 minutes and then strain the rice; discard cooking water. It will be partially cooked—if you break a grain of rice, you will see an outer translucent ring and a tiny, opaque inner ring.

When the lamb is tender, remove lid and increase the heat to medium, stirring often to prevent scorching, and cook until the liquid starts to thicken and reduces to about 1 1/2 cups (360ml), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Using a clean, large wooden spoon or spatula, spread the rice out in an even layer over the meat in the Dutch oven.

Set oven rack at the middle position and heat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Place half the saffron threads in a mortar and pestle and grind to a fine powder. In a small saucepan placed over low heat, warm the milk just until it starts to bubble, then turn off the heat. Add the ground saffron and remaining saffron strands to the hot milk and let steep for 10 minutes.

Sprinkle the saffron-infused milk over the rice, followed by the rosewater and the pandan water. Garnish the top of the rice with the reserved caramelized onions. Cover the Dutch oven with two sheets of aluminum foil and crimp the overhang to form a tight seal, place the lid over the foil, and place the Dutch oven in the preheated oven for 20 minutes to let the rice steam. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Uncover the pot and carefully peel off the aluminum seal. Use a fork to loosen the rice a little and serve immediately straight from the Dutch oven.

Rub the salmon with olive oil, and season with salt. Place on a baking sheet with a lip, lined in foil, and broil for 10 minutes in the top third of the oven.

Meanwhile, make the glaze by whisking together the honey and harissa.

After 10 minutes, the top of the salmon will begin to go golden. Brush most of the honey-harissa glaze over the salmon, reserving a bit to gloss the salmon with later.

Broil for 5 minutes with the glaze on, basting the glaze back over the salmon once or twice as it cooks. Remove the salmon from the oven, and pour the rest of the glaze over it.

Broiled Mint Msemen With Honey Recipe,Michael Harlan Turkell,African,"For the Msemen:

1 pound 6 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (640g; 5 cups)

1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight

1 teaspoon (4g) granulated sugar

1/4 (1g) teaspoon instant yeast

1 1/2 cups (355g) warm water

1 large egg

1/4 cup (60g) vegetable oil

1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter

1 cup packed fresh mint leaves

1/4 cup (45g) fine semolina

Flaky salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling

For the Honey-Butter:

1/2 cup (120g) honey

1/2 cup (120g) unsalted butter

1 teaspoon (5g) water

Kosher salt","For the Msemen: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine flour, salt, sugar, and yeast. With the mixer running at low speed, slowly drizzle in the water. Add the egg and mix until thoroughly combined. Increase speed to medium and continue to knead the dough until a very slightly sticky and tender dough forms, about 2 minutes.

Transfer dough to a greased mixing bowl. Lightly rub the dough all over with oil. Cover with plastic and let rest in a warm place until the dough increases in size by about 50 percent, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine butter and oil and heat over medium heat until butter is melted. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

Transfer dough to a lightly oiled work surface. Punch down the dough. Coat your hands with the butter/oil mixture. Divide the dough into eight equal portions and coat lightly with the butter/oil mixture. Arrange dough balls on a rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic and let rest until dough balls have increased in size by about 50 percent, about 1 hour.

Working one at a time on a lightly oiled work surface, and using greased hands, flatten each dough ball, pushing outwards from the center to make an 8- by 8-inch square; the dough square should have a roughly even thickness throughout. Generously brush the surface of dough with the butter/oil mixture, dust all over with a large pinch of semolina, and sprinkle mint leaves on top of the dough.

Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter. Brush the top with more butter/oil, dust with more semolina, and season with a pinch of flaky salt. Fold into thirds once more to make a square packet. Return the dough packets to the baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic and let rest at least 15 minutes and up to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, Make the Honey-Butter: In a small saucepan, combine honey, butter, and water and cook over medium heat until butter is melted and the sauce is smooth, stirring to combine. Season with salt and set aside to cool.

To Finish: Preheat broiler and set oven rack to 6 inches from broiler element. Working one dough packet at a time, set a dough packet on a second rimmed baking sheet. Coat hands once more in butter/oil mixture, and, using your fingers, press and stretch the dough packet out to a roughly 6- by 6-inch square.

Broil the dough packet until browned in spots, turning once halfway through, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a platter and cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough packets (be sure to let baking sheet cool to a safe level between uses). Serve with honey butter.

Lablabi (Tunisian Chickpea Soup) From 'The Heart of the Plate',Kate Williams,African,"2 cups (1 pound) dried chickpeas, soaked for at least 4 hours or up to overnight

8 cups water

3–4 large garlic cloves, peeled and halved

2 tablespoons olive oil

2 cups minced onion (1 large)

2 teaspoons ground cumin

1 tablespoon minced or crushed garlic

1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or more to taste

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Black pepper","Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas, then transfer them to a soup pot, large saucepan, or Dutch oven, along with the water and garlic cloves. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, partially cover, and cook until the chickpeas are completely tender, an hour or longer. (You want to err on the soft side.)

Meanwhile, place a medium skillet over medium heat for about a minute, then add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the onion and cumin, and cook, stirring, for 5 to 8 minutes, until the onion becomes soft. Add the minced garlic and 1 teaspoon of the salt, reduce the heat to low, and continue to cook for another 10 minutes. Cover and cook over the lowest possible heat for 10 minutes longer, then remove from the heat.

When the chickpeas are very tender, add the onion-garlic mixture, scraping in as much as you can of whatever adhered to the pan. Collect the remaining parts (this is flavor!) by adding the lemon juice to the skillet and stirring it around, scraping the sides and bottom (deglazing), then pouring all of this onto the chickpeas as well. Taste to adjust the salt (you will likely want to add up to another 1/2 teaspoon) and grind in a generous amount of black pepper to taste. At this point, if you choose, you can puree some of the chickpeas with an immersion blender.

Cover and let the soup simmer for another 10 minutes or so before serving.

Optional Enhancements:


A few strands of saffron added to the cooking water in step 1


A spoonful of harissa


Touches of torn fresh flat-leaf parsley, cilantro, or mint

One 2-inch segment peeled fresh ginger (about 3/4 ounce; 20g), roughly chopped

1 quart (1L) homemade chicken stock or store-bought, low-sodium broth, or vegetable stock

9 tablespoons (135ml) canola or other neutral oil

1/2 teaspoon Nigerian curry powder, such as Lion's Brand, or more to taste (optional, see note)

Ground Cameroon pepper, to taste (see note)

4 pounds (1.8kg) cooked bone-in chicken (optional)

Torn fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)","Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) and set oven racks in the top- and bottom-third positions. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, toss red bell pepper with 2 tablespoons (30ml) palm oil. Season with salt. Transfer in an even layer to one of the rimmed baking sheets. In the same large bowl, toss the garlic, tomato, Fresno chili, habanero, onion, and ginger with 4 tablespoons (60ml) palm oil. Season with salt. Transfer in an even layer to the other rimmed baking sheet.

Roast the vegetables, stirring and rotating baking sheets once or twice during cooking, until all are tender, some of their juices have cooked off, and they are charred in spots, about 45 minutes for the red bell peppers and 30 minutes for the tomatoes, chilies, and onions.

Scrape all of the roasted vegetables into a blender jar and blend until either a chunky or smooth purée forms (the consistency of your obe ata is up to you; we like a smoother sauce for when it is used for stews and a chunkier one when it is used as a dip or condiment).

Transfer vegetable purée to a Dutch oven. Stir in chicken stock, remaining 3 tablespoons (45ml) palm oil, canola oil, curry powder, and Cameroon pepper. Bring to a simmer. Season lightly with salt, then simmer until sauce is reduced to a good stew-like thickness that can coat pieces of meat well, about 1 hour. If desired, season with additional curry powder and/or Cameroon pepper to meet your desired flavor and spice level.

If serving with chicken, add cooked chicken to the Dutch oven and simmer until chicken is warmed through, about 15 minutes. Serve with warm rice and garnish with torn basil leaves, if desired.

Alternatively, you can continue to cook down the sauce until it thickens to a dip-like consistency, about 3 hours; the oils will break from the sauce in this time and fry the vegetable purée, deepening its flavor further.

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

For the Suya:

1 pound (450g) beef flank or sirloin steak (see note)

3 tablespoons (45ml) peanut oil, or neutral-flavored oil, such as canola

For Serving:

Thinly sliced red onions, tomatoes, lime halves, crisp lettuce, and coriander leaves","For the Yajin Kuli: In a small mixing bowl, combine all ingredients and whisk to mix thoroughly, about 30 seconds. Set aside.

For the Suya: Wrap beef tightly in plastic wrap and place on a plate or small baking sheet and set in the freezer until the beef is partially frozen and firm to the touch, 15-30 minutes. Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice beef against the grain into 2 inch long, 1 inch wide, and 1/8 inch thick strips. (The easiest and most efficient way to do this is to start by portioning the beef into 2 inch-wide by 1 inch-thick pieces, and then slicing those pieces crosswise into 1/8 inch-thick strips.)

Place sliced beef in large mixing bowl and drizzle peanut oil over it. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of yajin kuli over the beef and carefully toss and massage spice rub into beef until it is evenly coated. Cover, place in refrigerator, and allow beef to marinate for at least half an hour and up to 8 hours.

Working with one piece of beef at a time, thread beef onto skewers, piercing each piece through twice to secure it, then bunching meat tightly together like an accordion. Continue threading beef onto skewer, making sure it's bunched tightly together, leaving no parts of the skewer exposed except for a 2-inch handle at the bottom, and the pointy tip at the top. Repeat skewering process with remaining beef.

If Using Skewer-Specific Grill Setup: Set up grill for skewers, making sure to adjust distance between bricks to the length of your skewers. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly in the channel between the bricks.

Place skewers directly over the hot coals, balancing them on top of the bricks, with the handles overhanging the bricks closest to you, and the tips balancing on the farther wall of bricks. Cook, turning frequently, until beef is lightly charred, and a piece of beef looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, about 8 minutes; if flare-ups occur, move the skewers around as needed to get them away from the flames. Transfer to serving platter and let rest 2-3 minutes. (In Nigeria, the cooked suya is left to rest for a few hours and then reheated over the grills later, which intensifies the flavors.)

If Using Conventional Charcoal or Gas Grill: Light 1 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate.

Place skewers on grate and cook over direct heat, turning once, until charred on both sides and a piece of beef looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, about 8 minutes. Transfer to serving platter and let rest 2-3 minutes. (In Nigeria, the cooked suya is left to rest for a few hours and then reheated over the grills later, which intensifies the flavors.)

Toad in the Hole with Onion Gravy Recipe,Barbara Hanson,British,"For toad:

1 cup flour

1 cup milk

2 eggs

Pinch of salt

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1 pound Cumberland sausage

For gravy:

1 tablespoon butter

1 medium onion, chopped

1 1/2 tablespoons flour

1 cup beef stock or broth

Worcestershire sauce, to taste

Salt and pepper","For toad:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

While oven is heating, prepare batter: Whisk together flour, milk, eggs, and salt until smooth. Let stand for 10 minutes or so.

Heat oil over medium-high heat in large pan. Cut sausages into individual links. Pierce each sausage in a few places with a sharp knife.

Add sausages to pan, brown without cooking through, about 10 minutes. Adjust heat if necessary to prevent burning.

Directly from the heat, while sausages and fat are still extremely hot (this is absolutely critical) dump all into a 9x9” baking dish. Quickly arrange so sausages don’t overlap, pour batter directly over, and pop into oven. Bake for 40 minutes, without peeking, until puffed and golden. Okay, you can peek, gently. Open the oven door only a crack to check the color within the last five minutes of cooking time.

For gravy:

Heat butter over medium heat in medium saucepan. Add onions and saute until golden, almost lightly browned, about 10 minutes.

Add flour. Stir, in an attempt to distribute the flour, about a minute.

Pour in beef stock, and let come to a simmer as it thickens. Simmer for a few minutes to get rid of the floury taste. Add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.

Serve onion gravy alongside, or atop, the toad in the hole.

Garlic- and Herb-Roasted Pork Loin With Crackling and Spiced Apple Chutney Recipe,Emily and Matt Clifton,British,"For the pork loin:

One (4- to 5-pound; 2- to 2 1/2-kg) pork loin, center cut with rind still intact (see note)

Kosher salt

1/4 cup (60ml) neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed

2 heads garlic, cut in half across the bulbs

8 sprigs fresh thyme

2 sprigs fresh rosemary

For the Spiced Apple Chutney:

4 tart baking apples (such as Granny Smith), peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch dice

3/4 cup chopped yellow onion

2 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated (20g)

1/2 cup pomegranate juice (120ml)

1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (150ml)

3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed (about 5 ounces; 140g)

1 teaspoon mustard seeds (about 2g)

1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

1 star anise pod","For the pork: Dry the skin as much as possible with a paper towel. Generously season the meat (not the skin) with kosher salt, including in between the ribs and meat. Place the roast on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to the refrigerator and let rest, uncovered, at least overnight and up to three days.

When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C). If the butcher has not done it for you, score the rind with a very sharp knife, using long, parallel slits 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch apart across the width of the loin; be careful not to cut into the flesh.

Flip the loin over and rub the flesh side with the remaining oil. Lift the meat from the bones. Place the garlic, thyme, and rosemary up against the meat. Using butcher's twine, tie the ribs back to the loin, with the aromatics sandwiched in between.

Rub the rind with more salt, ensuring that the salt is rubbed well into the slits. Brush the rind with 2 tablespoons of oil.

Place the loin, skin-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan or baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325°F (163°C) and cook until an instant-read thermometer poked into the center of the loin reaches 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare, or 140°F (60°C) for medium, about 1 hour. Skin should be puffy and crisp; if it’s not puffy enough, remove the roast from the oven, preheat the broiler, and place the roast a few inches under the broiler until the skin puffs.

While the pork roasts, make the Apple Chutney: Combine the apples, onion, ginger, pomegranate juice, vinegar, brown sugar, mustard seeds, pepper flakes, star anise, and salt in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 45 minutes. Remove the star anise and allow to cool.

When the roast is done, remove it from the oven and let the loin rest on a carving board for 30 minutes.

Remove the ribs by cutting the remaining flap, discard the garlic and herbs. Carve the loin into slices following the scores so that each slice has a segment of crackling (approximately a 1/4-inch-wide strip). Serve the warm pork loin with apple chutney and your preferred sides.

1/2 pound caul fat

Cabbage:

4 strips thick cut bacon, chopped

Place trotters in a large stock pot with bay leaves, carrots, onions, garlic and peppercorns. Cover with water then bring to a simmer skimming foam off the top of the pot until trotters are tender (test with a knife) 2-3 hours. Remove trotters then strain liquid through a strainer. Reserve liquid.

Cover potatoes with water and bring to a simmer, cook until tender, then drain and mash. Add cream then season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow to cool to room temperature.

When trotters are still warm but cool enough to handle, unwrap the cheese cloth and gently separate the halves. Remove all the bones from the trotter, trying to keep each half as intact as possible. If any bits of trotter fall off, reserve them. Season both sides of each trotter half with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Carefully unroll caul fat so that the thin sheets are separated and easy to handle. Place each trotter half skin side down on a cutting board then divide potatoes evenly between trotters. Roll trotter around potatoes, then gently wrap each trotter half with caul fat. Repeat with remaining trotters. Place wrapped trotter halves on rack in baking pan and roast until deep golden brown, about an hour.

In a large skillet cook bacon over medium high heat until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, about 6 minutes. Add any bits of trotter that fell off while the bones were being removed and cook until beginning to brown. Add cabbage and cook until wilted, adding some of the pork stock leftover from cooking the trotters if anything begins to stick. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

5 cups (1/4 liter) beef stock","Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Season the beef with salt and pepper; sear in a hot roasting pan with the olive oil to brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes each side. Transfer to oven; roast, allowing 15 minutes a pound (450 g) for rare or 20 minutes a pound (450 g) for medium.

Make the Yorkshire pudding batter: Sift the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add the eggs and half the milk; beat until smooth. Mix in remaining milk; let batter rest.

When beef is cooked, transfer it to a warmed plate; let it rest, lightly covered with foil, in a warm place while you cook the puddings and make the gravy. Raise oven to 450°F (230°C). Put 1 teaspoon (5 ml) vegetable oil--or hot from the roasting pan--into each section of a 12-hole Yorkshire pudding tray (or a muffin tray); put it in the oven on the top shelf until very hot, almost smoking.

Meanwhile, whisk pudding batter again. As soon as you take the tray from the oven, ladle in the batter so each cup is three-quarters full (it should sizzle); immediately put tray back in oven. Bake for 12 to 20 minutes until the Yorkshire puddings are well risen, golden brown, and crisp. Don't open oven door until end or they might collapse.

To make the gravy, pour off the excess fat from roasting pan, place pan over medium heat, and add the thyme, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, pour in the wine, and bring to a simmer. Squash the tomatoes with a potato masher to help thicken sauce. Pour in the stock; simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Pass gravy through a sieve, pressing vegetables to extract flavor. Bring gravy back to boil; reduce to a gravy consistency. Check the seasoning.

Working in a mixing bowl with the whisk, beat the egg(s) and sugar together until thick and pale. Stir in the vanilla, if you’re using it, and then the melted butter. The mixture will be smooth and shiny. Stir in the dry ingredients and scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Top with the apples, making a spiral pattern. Leave some space between each slice, so the batter can puff up between the wedges – it looks much nicer with the puffs.

Slide the pan into the oven and bake for about 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack.

If you want to glaze the cake, warm a few spoonfuls of jelly and a splash of water in a microwave oven (or a saucepan) until the jelly liquefies. Brush the jelly over the hot cake.

Let the cake cool for at least 15 minutes, or wait until it reaches room temperature, before you cut it into wedges to serve.

1/2 small cabbage, outer leaf removed and sliced thin

1/2 cup half and half or milk

Splash neutral cooking oil, optional

Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste","In a large pot, cover the potatoes with cold salted water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

While the potatoes are cooking, add the bacon in a 9 to 12-inch ovenproof pan. (No plastic handles!) Add a small splash of oil, if the bacon is lean. Cook over medium to medium-low heat until lightly browned with crisped edges, 10 minutes or less. Set aside.

Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. No need to be overly thorough. Add 1/2 stick butter and melt over medium to medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 10 or so minutes.

Add the cabbage to the onion, toss thoroughly with the onion, and cover. Cook until cabbage is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally, lowering the heat if the onions are browning too much. (A little browning is okay, but well-done onions will overwhelm the potatoes.)

Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Dry, shaking the pot, over high heat for about ten seconds. Turn off the heat. Add 2 tablespoons butter and the half and half, and mash—by hand—to your liking. I prefer a few lumps myself—remember, this is a country dish. And salt and pepper to taste, then add even more pepper!

Preheat broiler.

Dump the cabbage-onion mix into the potatoes and mix thoroughly. Return the bacon to the pan, distributing more or less evenly. Scoop the potatoes on top, spreading to cover bacon. Don’t smooth down too much.

Dot the top with remaining butter (you may not need all of it). Run under the broiler until the top is nicely browned. Let cool a bit before serving.","Sides,Irish,Bacon,Russet Potatoes",https://www.seriouseats.com/colcannon-recipe

If the bacon is very salty there will be a white froth on top of the water, in which case it is preferable to discard the water and start again.

It may be necessary to change the water several times, depending on how salty the bacon is. Finally, cover with hot water and the lid of the pot and simmer until almost cooked, allowing 20 minutes for every 1lb.

Meanwhile, trim the outer leaves of the cabbage and cut it into quarters, removing the core. Discard the core and outer leaves. Slice the cabbage across the grain into thin shreds. If necessary, wash it quickly in cold water. About 20 minutes before the end of cooking the bacon, add the shredded cabbage to the water in which the bacon is boiling.

Spotted Dog Recipe | Cook the Book,Caroline Russock,Spanish,"3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, preferably unbleached

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon salt

2 teaspoons sugar

2/3 cup golden or seedless raisins (or more if you'd like)

1 organic egg

1 2/3 cups buttermilk","Preheat the oven to 425°F.

mixing bowl, sift the flour and baking soda; then add the salt, sugar, and raisins. Mix well by lifting the flour and fruit up in to your hands and then letting them fall back into the bowl through your fingers. This adds more air and therefore more lightness to your finished bread. Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture.

Break the egg into the base of a measuring glass and add the buttermilk to the 1 1/2 cups line (the egg is part of the liquid measurement) and mix together.

Pour most of this milk and egg mixture into the flour. Using one hand with the fingers open and stiff, mix in a full circle drawing in the flour mixture from the sides of the bowl, adding more milk if necessary. The dough should be softish, but not too wet and sticky.

The trick with Spotted Dog, like all soda breads, is not to overmix the dough. Mix it as quickly and gently as possible, thus keeping it light and airy. When the dough all comes together, turn it out onto a well-floured work surface.

Wash and dry your hands. With floured fingers, roll the dough lightly for a few seconds - just enough to tidy it up. Then pat the dough into a round about 2in thick. Transfer to a baking sheet dusted lightly with flour. Use a sharp knife to cut a deep cross on it, letting the cuts go over the sides of the bread. Prick with a knife in the four triangles.

Put into the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 400°F. Cook for 35-40 minutes. If you are in doubt about the bread being cooked, tap the bottom: if it is cooked it will sound hollow.

This bread is cooked at a lower temperature than soda bread because the egg browns faster at a higher heat. Serve freshly baked, cut into thick slices and smeared with butter and jam. Spotted Dog is also really good eaten with Cheddar cheese.","Quick Breads,Irish",https://www.seriouseats.com/spotted-dog-soda-bread-recipe

1 teaspoon table salt

2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) instant yeast

1 tablespoon cinnamon

Raisins (optional)

Pearl sugar or granulated sugar (optional)","Melt 1 stick butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add the milk and heat until lukewarm. Remove from heat. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar and cardamom and stir until dissolved.

In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine flour, salt, and instant yeast until homogeneous. Add liquid from step 1 and knead until a tacky dough forms. To knead by hand, turn dough out on lightly floured counter and knead until smooth and not too sticky, about 10 minutes, dusting with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. To knead in a stand mixer, knead on medium low speed until dough is smooth and elastic. It should pull away from the sides of the mixer, but just barely stick to the bottom. If not, add small amounts of flour and allow them to be fully incorporated until the right texture is achieved.

Place dough ball in large bowl and cover with a clean towel. Leave bowl in a warm spot until risen to double size, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine remaining stick of butter, cinnamon, and remaining 1/2 cup of sugar in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until butter is just melted, then allow to cool while dough finishes rising.

Divide dough into two equal balls.

With rolling pin, roll out one ball into a square approximately 14-inches to a side and 1/2-inch thick. Spread half of butter/sugar mixture over dough leaving a 1/4-inch gap on the top and bottom, but spreading all the way to the sides. (Optional: Sprinkle on raisins.)

Roll dough away from you into a tight log and place seam-side down on a cutting board. Use a sharp chef's knife to cut it into 1-inch rolls, using a gently sawing motion. Transfer rolls to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart.

Repeat steps 6 and 7 with remaining ball of dough, using an additional rimmed baking sheet (or, if you don't mind your rolls sticking together, you can fit them all into a single baking sheet). Cover rolls with plastic wrap and allow to rise in refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours.

When ready to bake, remove pans from the refrigerator and place on the counter while the oven preheats to 450°F. Adjust oven racks to upper middle and lower middle position. Bake until puffed and lightly browned, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through baking.

12 to 20 black olives, pitted and sliced

2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered lengthwise (optional)","Begin desalting the salt cod 2 to 3 days before (depending on the cut): Dry salt cod—bacalao—needs to be desalted before using. Soaking in water removes the salt, rehydrates the cod, and softens the flesh. The process takes at least 36 hours to 2 days, changing the water at least four to six times; fatter loin pieces can take as long as 4 days; the thickest loin pieces can take even longer.

Rinse the cod under cool running water. Place skin-side up (to keep the salt from concentrating here) in a bowl and cover with fresh water. Change the water immediately, rinse out the bowl, and refill with cool water. Arrange the pieces in the bowl skin-side up. Place the bowl in the refrigerator and let the cod soak for 12 hours. Drain, rinse out the bowl, change the water, and soak for another 12 hours. Change the water every 6 to 8 hours or so for the next 24 hours. Place the pieces skin-side down during the final 12 hours. Drain the cod, rinse, and gently squeeze out some of the excess water. Place in a strainer—with the skin side up again—and let drain for at least 30 minutes. (For certain recipes where you don’t want any salty moisture running into the sauce, I recommend draining for significantly longer.)

To check if it is ready, take a pinch of the fish and taste. It should be slightly salty but not disagreeably so. (If it is too salty, change the water and continue to soak.) Drain, rinse, gently squeeze out excess moisture, and pat dry with paper towels. Carefully debone.

Preheat a skillet over high heat and lightly oil it. Lay on the cod and cook only until it can be flaked apart, 4 to 6 minutes depending on the thickness. Transfer to a plate. Remove the skin and gently flake apart, carefully checking for any bones.

Section the orange segments. To do this, peel the oranges and then trim any white pith with a sharp knife. Carefully cut along the membranes and remove the individual segments. Set the segments in a bowl along with any juices.

Add the cod to the bowl along with the scallion and olives. Drizzle over the olive oil and gently toss. Divide the salad among plates and garnish each with hard-boiled egg, if desired.","Snacks & Appetizers,Spanish,Boiled Eggs,Orange,Cod",https://www.seriouseats.com/salt-cod-orange-and-olive-salad-remojon-de-na
"Gravlax With Caraway, Coriander, and Mustard-Dill Sauce Recipe",Daniel Gritzer,Spanish,"Kosher salt

1 (2-pound; 900g) skin-on sushi-grade salmon fillet, pin bones removed by fishmonger

1 teaspoon caraway seeds

1 teaspoon coriander seeds

40g kosher salt (about 4 tablespoons), plus more for washing salmon

15g sugar (about 1 tablespoon)

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper or black pepper

2 large bunches dill

For the Sauce:

3 tablespoons (45ml) distilled white vinegar

2 tablespoons roughly chopped dill fronds

5 tablespoons (75ml) Dijon mustard

1 tablespoon (15g) sugar

1/4 cup (60ml) canola or vegetable oil

Freshly ground black pepper

Sliced pumpernickel bread, for serving","Fill a large bowl with cold water and add enough salt to make it taste like the sea. Add salmon and let stand 10 minutes.

In a skillet, toast caraway and coriander seeds over high heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind finely.

In a small bowl, stir together salt, sugar, ground caraway and coriander seeds, and white or black pepper until thoroughly combined.

Remove salmon from bath and pat dry with paper towels. On a work surface, turn salmon skin side up and sprinkle about half of salt mixture all over, rubbing in with fingers.

Arrange half of dill all over the bottom of a baking dish large enough to hold salmon. Set salmon skin side down on bed of dill. Rub remaining salt mixture all over top and sides of salmon, then top with remaining dill. Cover salmon with plastic, then top with a weight (such as a smaller baking dish or plate with cans of beans on top). Refrigerate for 1 day.

After 1 day, unpack salmon and turn skin side up. Re-pack with dill, cover with plastic, and set weight back on top. Refrigerate until salmon is sufficiently cured, 1 day longer for a lighter cure or 2 days longer for slightly more cure (which will mean a slightly firmer texture and saltier flavor).

For the Sauce: Before serving, make the sauce. In a blender or mini food processor, or using an immersion blender, combine vinegar with chopped dill fronds, mustard, and sugar and blend until dill is very finely chopped. Add oil and blend until a smooth sauce has formed. Season with salt and pepper.

Unpack salmon, scraping off dill, and set on a work surface. Using a very sharp slicing knife, cut gravlax on a bias into thin slices. Arrange on slices of pumpernickel bread and drizzle sauce on top. Serve. Gravlax can be kept refrigerated, tightly wrapped in plastic, for approximately 5 days after curing.","Salmon,Scandinavian,No-Cook Seafood,Dill,Snacks & Appetizers",https://www.seriouseats.com/gravlax-cured-salmon-recipe

Empanada with Marinated Pork and Roasted Red Peppers (Empanada de Lomo) From 'Spain',Kate Williams,Spanish,"4 garlic cloves, peeled

8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the bowl

2 tablespoons dry white wine

1 1/2 teaspoons Spanish pimentón dulche (sweet paprika)

1 teaspoon dried oregano

Salt

1 bay leaf

12 ounces (340 g) pork fillets, thinly cut into 1/3-inch (1-cm) thick strips

3 cups (375 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface and pan

1 1/2 tablespoons (20 g) firmly packed fresh baker's yeast or 2 teaspoons active dry yeast

1/2 cup (120 ml) whole milk, warmed

2 eggs, whisked

2 medium onions, thinly sliced

1 red bell pepper, halved crosswise and sliced into thin lengthwise strips

Butter for greasing pan","In a large bowl, blend the garlic, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, the wine, 1 teaspoon of the pimentón, and the oregano. Season with salt and add the bay leaf and pork. Turn over to coat. Cover and marinate for at least a couple of hours.

Meanwhile, put the flour in a wide bowl and sprinkle in the remaining pimentón and 1 teaspoon salt, blend with your fingers, and make a crater in the middle. Dissolve the yeast in the milk and add along with one egg. Begin working into a ball while adding 2 tablespoons olive oil. (Add a touch more milk if needed.) Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work space and knead by hand for about 10 minutes, until supple and elastic and slightly tacky. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm corner of the kitchen for about 1 hour, or until about doubled in size.

In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat, add the onions, and cook until they begin to soften and turn pale, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and cook until it and the onions are tender and sweet, about 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cover the skillet toward the end. Transfer to a bowl.

Preheat a heavy skillet over high heat. Discard the garlic and bay leaf from the marinade. Working in single-layer batches that don’t crowd the pan, quickly brown the pork in its marinade, 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Transfer to the bowl and blend with the onions and bell peppers.

Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas mark 6.

Butter and flour a 10 1/2-inch/27-cm pie pan or line it with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit.

Divide the dough in half, with one piece slightly larger than the other. (The larger piece will be used for the bottom, the smaller for the top covering.) On a clean, lightly floured work surface, roll out the larger piece so that it will comfortably drape over the pie pan. Lay it over the pan, and gently tuck the inside against the sides of the pan.

Lay in the pork, bell pepper, and onions. Spread out in a thick, even layer.

Roll out the remaining piece of dough. Lay it on the top of the filling like a lid. Cut away and reserve the edges. Form a crimped edge by pinching the edges together with your fingers. Make a 1-inch/2.5-cm or so hole in the very center of the top to allow some steam to escape.

With the excess dough, decorate the top as desired. Roll out some pieces to run across the top or even make a cross, for instance, or make a simple braid to run along the edge.

Paint the top of the empanada with the whisked egg using a pastry brush.

Bake the empanada until the top is a lovely golden color, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the empanada cool before slicing into portions and serving.","Snacks & Appetizers,Spanish,Baking,Pork",https://www.seriouseats.com/empanada-with-marinated-pork-and-roasted-red

75 grams salt

25 grams sugar

12.5 grams pink curing salt (optional)

10 grams white or black pepper

2 to 3 tablespoons brandy (such as Cognac)","Let foie gras rest at room temperature for about 45 minutes before starting to clean. Split foie into two separate lobes with your hands. Working one lobe at a time, using a paring knife or small offset spatula and a pair of tweezers, carefully remove all the veins from the center of the liver, following the instructions in this slideshow. Discard veins and repeat with remaining half. Return foie gras to the refrigerator.

Combine salt, sugar, curing salt, and pepper in a spice grinder and grind into a fine powder.

Weigh foie gras, then weigh out exactly 2.5% of the foie gras' weight in spice mixture. For example, for a 500 gram piece of foie gras, you should have 12.5 grams of spice mixture (500 grams x 2.5%). Set aside remaining spice mixture for future use.

Lay a triple layer of plastic wrap, 12 by 18-inches on a cutting board. Remove foie gras from refrigerator and transfer to plastic wrap, exterior membrane-side down. Carefully butterfly with your fingertips, spreading the foie gras out and pushing it into shape with your hands until it forms a rough 9- by 9-inch square of even thickness.

Place half of weighed spice mixture in a fine mesh strainer and sprinkle evenly over top surface of foie gras. Sprinkle with half of cognac. Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top and carefully flip. Peel of plastic wrap from what is now the top, and sprinkle with remaining spice mixture and cognac. Flip back over and remove top piece of plastic wrap to expose surface again.

Slide foie with plastic on top of a bamboo sushi rolling mat, adjusting it so the bottom edge of the foie is flush with the bottom of the mat. Fold the trailing plastic wrap underneath. Carefully start rolling foie, using bamboo mat to keep it nice and tight until a complete cylinder is formed. Pull back tightly on bamboo to tighten cylinder.

Lay out a quadruple layer of cheesecloth about 16 inches wide by 2 feet long. Roll foie gras off of plastic onto the cheesecloth a few inches from the bottom edges. Carefully roll foie in cheesecloth, pulling back as you go to keep it very tight and even.

Twist ends of cheesecloth and secure one side with a short piece of twine. Secure other side with a 3-foot piece of twine. Twist twine around end of cheesecloth to tighten the roll, making the torchon shorter and shorter with each twist. Tighten until you see foie fat starting to leak out around the edges of the torchon and it has the consistency of a bike tire. Tie off cheesecloth

Hang torchon from a refrigerator rack for at least 1 day and up to 3.

Bring a large pot of water to 160°F (bubbles should just begin to appear on the bottom of the pan. Prepare a large ice bath. Submerge foie torchon for 2 minutes, then transfer immediately to ice bath. You should see little droplets of fat forming on the surface. Let rest for 10 minutes, then transfer to a triple layer of paper towels and roll to dry carefully.

Repeat the tightening step, using more twine to twist and shorten the ends of the torchon until the entire thing starts to show signs of leaking fat. Hang in refrigerator for at least 1 more night and up to 3.

Slice off ends of torchon through the cheesecloth (eat these ends for yourself), then unwrap the center portion. To serve, slice into disks. For better presentation, use a round pastry cutter to trim oxidized edges off of foie. Sprinkle with coarse salt, and serve with toast, preserves, or dried fruits.","Hors D'Oeuvres,French,Duck",https://www.seriouseats.com/foie-gras-torchon-recipe

French-Style Brown Butter New Potatoes Recipe,Sasha Marx,East African Cuisines,"1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces; 113g), cut into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)

1 pound (450g) small new potatoes, rinsed (see note)

Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

4 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)

2 garlic cloves (optional)

Sliced chives, for serving

Crème fraîche, for serving","In a medium (3-quart) saucepan or saucier, melt butter over medium heat. Add potatoes, a healthy pinch of salt, and pepper to taste. Cook, swirling saucepan and stirring frequently with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops. Make sure potatoes remain in a single, even layer in the saucepan while cooking. Continue cooking and stirring until butter begins to foam rapidly and turns golden yellow, 5 to 8 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium-low; add herbs and garlic (if using). Continue stirring and turning potatoes occasionally to promote even browning. At this point, the butter should be golden brown. Regulate heat so butter simmers at a very gentle bubble and foams up when you stir it. (Depending on the strength of your burner, you may need to reduce heat from medium-low to low.) Continue cooking until potatoes are completely tender (poke a potato with a sharp paring knife or cake tester to test for doneness) and deep golden brown, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and let potatoes rest for 5 minutes in the saucepan.

Toss potatoes to coat them in brown butter. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a serving bowl; reserve brown butter. Drizzle as much brown butter as you like over the potatoes and sprinkle with chives (if you like) and sea salt to taste.

Easy Pork Rillettes (Slow-Cooked Pork Spread) Recipe,J. Kenji López-Alt,East African Cuisines,"2 pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks (about 1kg)

Kosher salt

1/2 cup vegetable oil, lard, or duck fat (120ml)

4 bay leaves

6 fresh thyme sprigs

2 large shallots, very roughly chopped

4 medium cloves garlic, split in half

Freshly ground nutmeg, to taste","Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Season pork gently with salt and pack into a Dutch oven, roasting pan, or casserole dish. It should fit in a layer about 2 inches deep. Pour oil over the pork (if using lard or duck fat, heat until just melted before pouring over pork). Nestle bay leaves, thyme sprigs, shallots, and garlic in with the pork. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil, transfer to oven, and cook until pork is completely tender and shows very little resistance when pierced with a knife, about 3 hours.

Remove from oven and using tongs, discard bay leaves, thyme, shallots, and garlic. Set a large strainer over a heatproof bowl and carefully pour pork mixture into it. Reserve drained fat and juices.

Transfer pork chunks to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (see note). Turn mixer on to low speed and gradually increase speed to medium, allowing pork to break down and shred. Slowly drizzle in the fat and juices a few tablespoons at a time, tasting in between each addition until the mixture is as loose and creamy as you like it. Season to taste aggressively with salt (the mixture will get more bland as it chills, so add salt until it almost tastes too salty).

Carefully pack mixture into jars, spooning it in a little bit at a time and making sure to remove all air bubbles. Smooth tops of mixture with the back of a spoon, wipe rims of jars with a clean cloth, then pour a quarter inch of fat on top of each one. Close lids and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to a week before serving. Serve lightly chilled with bread or crackers and cornichons, whole grain mustard, and fruit preserves. Rillettes can also be frozen directly in their jars and held for several months.

Real Bouillabaisse (Bouillabaisse Marseillaise) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"For the Broth:

1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil

1 large yellow onion (12 ounces; 340g), diced

1 large leek (1 pound; 450g), washed of any grit and diced

1 medium fennel bulb (8 ounces; 225g), cored and diced

5 medium cloves garlic, crushed

1/2 teaspoon whole fennel seeds

2 large pinches saffron threads

One (2-inch) strip zest from 1 orange

Large pinch cayenne pepper or other red chili powder

2 sprigs thyme

2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste

6 plum tomatoes (1 1/4 pounds; 565g), cored, seeded, and diced

2 pounds (900g) whole fish or fish bones and heads (see note)

2 cups (475ml) dry white wine

1/4 cup (60ml) Pernod or pastis (optional)

2 quarts (1.9L) boiling water, or more as needed

2 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley

1 bay leaf

Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Rouille:

2 medium cloves garlic

1/4 cup crumbled stale bread or panko bread crumbs (1/2 ounce; 15g)

Large pinch cayenne pepper or other red chili powder

Pinch saffron threads

1 large egg yolk

Kosher or sea salt

1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil

To Finish:

3 to 5 pounds (1.3 to 2.25kg) mixed whole and/or filleted fish (see note)

1 pound (450g) mussels and/or crabs (optional; see note)

Kosher or sea salt

Baguette toasts, for serving","To Make the Broth: In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, leek, fennel, garlic, fennel seeds, saffron, orange zest, cayenne pepper, and thyme sprigs. Cook, stirring, until vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes; lower heat if necessary to prevent browning.

Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add diced tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes longer. Layer in whole fish and/or fish bones and heads, stirring to mix.

Add white wine and Pernod or pastis (if using), stirring to scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then boil until raw alcohol smell has cooked off, about 3 minutes.

Add enough boiling water to fully cover all ingredients in the pot. Add parsley and bay leaf, increase heat to high, and bring broth to a vigorous boil. Allow to boil rapidly for 5 minutes. Lower heat to a simmer and continue to cook for 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, Make the Rouille: Using a mortar and pestle, a blender, or a food processor, process garlic, bread, cayenne pepper, saffron, and egg yolk to a paste. Work in 2 tablespoons (30ml) liquid from fish broth pot to thin paste slightly. (This can also help a blender or food processor work the mixture more effectively.) Season with salt.

While pounding with the pestle, or with the blender or processor running at its lowest speed, drizzle in the olive oil. If the mixture seems too thick at any point, add fish broth, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until a thick, mayonnaise-like consistency is reached. Refrigerate the rouille until ready to use, up to 3 days.

To Finish: Working in batches, transfer broth and all ingredients, including fish bones, to a blender. Remove top vent from blender lid, cover with a folded clean kitchen towel, and turn blender on at lowest speed. (Keeping the blender fully sealed and turning it on at high speed immediately can be dangerous with hot liquids, so please don't do that.) Gradually increase speed to high, then blend until as smooth as possible. (This may take some time and will depend on your blender, but feel free to let it run for a minute or longer.)

Transfer blended soup to a fine-mesh strainer set over a clean pot and, using a wooden spoon, work the broth through the strainer, scraping and pressing, until only bones and very dry fibrous material are left. Repeat with remaining broth and bones. Season strained broth with salt and pepper. Alternatively, you can work the broth and all the bones and solids through the fine disk of a food mill, but this will only work with a high-quality, commercial-grade food mill (see the ""Special Equipment"" section for a link).

Return broth to heat and bring to a very gentle simmer. Working in batches if necessary, season the whole and filleted fish and fully submerge in broth. Poach until just cooked through, starting with the larger whole fish that will take the longest to cook and finishing with the fillets; feel free to check doneness by cutting into the thickest part of each fish or fillet. As each is done, transfer it to a serving platter and keep warm.

If using mussels or crabs, add to gently simmering broth and cook until mussels have just opened or crabs are cooked through. (This will depend on the size of your crabs; ask your fishmonger for advice if you need it.) Transfer to the serving platter.

Bring the platter of fish to the table along with the broth in the soup pot or a tureen. Guests can eat the soup and fish separately, or together in the same bowl. The soup is best served with baguette toasts smeared with the rouille.","Seafood,French,Braised & Stewed Seafood,Fish,Mussels",https://www.seriouseats.com/bouillabaisse-marseillaise-fish-stew-recipe
How to Make Choux Pastry (Pâte à Choux) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"1 cup (235g) water or milk (see note)

6 tablespoons (84g) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

2 teaspoons (8g) sugar (optional; see note)

1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight

4 1/2 ounces (128g) all-purpose flour, sifted

4 large eggs (200g)","In a 3-quart stainless-steel saucier or saucepan, combine water (or milk), butter, sugar (if using), and salt.

Set over high and and cook until liquid comes to a rolling boil and butter has fully melted, about 2 minutes (the small butter cubes should be fully melted just about at the same time the liquid hits a strong boil).

Remove from heat and add flour. Using a wooden spoon or stiff silicone spatula, thoroughly mix in flour until no lumps remain (make sure to hunt down and smash out any stubborn ones).

Return saucepan to medium-high heat and cook, stirring very frequently, until dough registers 175°F (80°C) on an instant-read thermometer; if you don't have a thermometer, other signs the dough is ready include a thin starchy film forming all over the inside of the saucier and the dough pulling together into a cohesive mass.

To use a stand mixer: Transfer dough to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle and beat at medium speed until dough registers 145°F on an instant-read thermometer (you need the dough cool enough that it doesn't cook the eggs when they hit it).

Add eggs one at a time, making sure each is fully beaten into the dough before adding the next; it can help to start the mixer at medium-low speed for the first egg and then increase the speed to medium once the choux batter begins to develop.

Scrape down sides of mixer bowl, then mix once more at medium speed just to ensure the choux batter is fully mixed, about 5 seconds.

Alternatively, to incorporate eggs by hand: Let dough cool in saucepan, stirring frequently, until it registers 145°F on an instant-read thermometer. Add eggs 1 at a time, stirring well between additions until each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next, until a smooth, shiny paste forms.

Use choux right away, or hold at room temperature for up to 2 hours before using; how you use the choux will depend on the application, though it’s important to prevent a skin from forming, either by transferring the choux right away to a pastry or zipper-lock bag and keeping it sealed, or pressing plastic wrap directly against the choux’s surface.","Pastries,French,Easter Desserts",https://www.seriouseats.com/choux-pastry

12 tablespoons (168g) unsalted butter

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 pound (450g) asparagus, woody ends trimmed

1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil, divided","In a small saucepan, combine wine, vinegar, shallots, tarragon stems, and black peppercorns, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Adjust heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until reduced to about 1 1/2 tablespoons of liquid, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully strain liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a small bowl, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Let mixture cool slightly.

In a tall-sided cup that barely fits the head of an immersion blender, combine egg yolks, miso, and the wine-vinegar reduction. Using an immersion blender. Blend mixture until well-combined, about 30 seconds.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over high heat, swirling constantly, until foaming subsides. Transfer butter to a 1-cup liquid measuring cup. Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat.

Place head of immersion blender into the bottom of the cup and turn it on. With the blender constantly running, slowly pour hot butter into cup in a thin and steady stream. Continue blending, raising and lowering blender head slightly to fully emulsify butter with the egg yolk mixture. Sauce should be thick and creamy, able to coat a spoon but still flow off of it. If it is too thick, whisk in a small amount of water to thin it out. Stir in minced tarragon and season to taste with salt. Transfer to a small lidded pot and keep in a warm place for up to 1 hour before serving. Béarnaise cannot be cooled and reheated.

Add half of the asparagus to the preheated cast iron skillet and arrange in a single layer. Cook, turning occasionally, until spears are lightly charred all over and just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes for thin spears, 5 to 8 minutes for thick spears. Carefully add half of the vegetable oil to the skillet, toss to coat asparagus with oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer asparagus to a warmed serving plate. Repeat with remaining asparagus and vegetable oil.

Choucroute Garnie à l'Alsacienne (Alsatian Braised Sauerkraut With Mixed Meats and Sausages) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"1 pound (450g) boneless pork loin

1 pound (450g) boneless pork shoulder

Kosher salt

1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (90ml) lard, goose fat, duck fat, or vegetable oil, divided

2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced (about 12 ounces; 350g total)

2 cups (480ml) dry white wine, such as Riesling or Silvaner (see note)

1 1/2 pounds (680g) mixed French- and/or German-style emulsified sausages, such as frankfurters, bratwurst, weisswurst, boudin blanc, boudin noir, or knackwurst

2 smoked pork chops (about 1 1/4 pounds; 560g total)

5 small Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, halved, and simmered in salted water until tender

2 tablespoons (30ml) kirsch (cherry brandy; optional)","Generously season pork loin and shoulder all over with salt. You can either proceed with the rest of the recipe right away, or, if you have time, place both cuts on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for up to 2 days. (Pre-salting the fresh cuts of pork will season them deeply and help them retain juiciness later.)

Preheat oven to 250°F (121°C). In a large Dutch oven, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) goose fat (or duck fat, lard, or oil) over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 10 minutes.

Add wine, stock, and cheesecloth sachet to onions. Nestle pork shoulder, slab bacon, and ham hock in onions and braising liquids and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cut a parchment paper lid sized to fit Dutch oven and set directly on top of meats and liquid. Transfer to oven and cook for 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, Cook Pork Loin: Place pork loin in a small ovenproof skillet or on a rimmed baking sheet and cook on a separate rack in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 120°F (49°C), about 1 hour. Set aside.

Meanwhile, Prepare Salt Pork (if using): Fill a large saucepan with water, add salt pork, and bring to a gentle simmer. Continue to cook at a very gentle simmer for 1 hour, then transfer salt pork to Dutch oven for remainder of cooking time.

Meanwhile, Prepare Sauerkraut: In a colander, lightly rinse sauerkraut under cold running water, then taste; depending on how much of its sour flavor you want to preserve, you can stop here or continue to rinse until desired flavor is reached. (This will depend on the age and flavor of the sauerkraut and your personal preference.) Using your hands, squeeze sauerkraut dry of excess water.

After meats in Dutch oven have cooked for 1 1/2 hours, per instructions in step 3, add sauerkraut to Dutch oven, mixing it into braising liquids and meats. Raise oven temperature to 300°F (149°C), re-cover with parchment paper lid, and cook until meats are very tender, about 1 hour longer.

To Finish the Dish: Fill a large saucepan with water and bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat. Add sausages, lower heat to maintain a bare simmer, and cook until heated through, about 10 minutes. Keep warm.

In a skillet, heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) fat or oil over high heat until shimmering. Add reserved pork loin from step 4 and sear, turning often, until well browned all over, about 3 minutes per side. Slice into medallions.

Remove parchment paper lid from Dutch oven and add pork loin medallions, smoked pork chops, and potatoes. Return to oven and cook until chops and loin are just heated through, 10 to 20 minutes.

Remove all meats from Dutch oven and set aside on a clean rimmed baking sheet. Discard cheesecloth sachet. Season sauerkraut with salt and stir in kirsch, if using. Using a slotted spoon, heap sauerkraut onto a large warmed serving platter, allowing any excess juices to drain off and arranging potatoes throughout. Drain poached sausages.

Gâteau Invisible (Invisible Apple Cake) Recipe,Tim Chin,East African Cuisines,"For the Cake:

Vegetable oil or cooking spray, for greasing the pan

1 cup all-purpose flour (5 ounces; 142g), plus more for dusting the pan

1 teaspoon baking powder

3 tablespoons (54g) white miso (see note)

2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, melted

1/2 cup whole milk (120ml)

3 large eggs

2/3 cup (4 3/4 ounces; 133g) sugar

2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg) apples, such as Fuji or Pink Lady, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/16- to 1/8-inch thick slices (see note)

For the Caramel Sauce:

1/4 cup (60ml) water

1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 1/4 ounces; 120g) sugar

3/4 cup (180ml) heavy cream

2 tablespoons (36g) white miso","For the Cake: Grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line with a 8- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper so that parchment hangs over the long sides of the pan, forming a sling.

Grease exposed sides of parchment paper, then dust with flour, making sure to lightly coat bottom and sides; carefully tap out excess flour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C).

In a small bowl, whisk flour and baking powder until well combined, at least 30 seconds; set bowl aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk miso and butter until miso is broken up. Whisk in roughly 2 tablespoons of milk until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining milk until smooth; set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar at medium speed until pale and glossy, 60 to 90 seconds. (Alternatively, beat eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric handheld mixer or a whisk, about 90 seconds for the electric mixer and 2 minutes for the whisk.)

Whisk in half of flour mixture until just combined. Whisk in milk mixture, followed by remaining flour mixture, until no lumps remain.

Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir apples into batter until evenly coated.

Using clean hands, arrange apple slices in prepared loaf pan in an overlapping pattern, making sure that flat sides of the apples are flush with the edges of pan (as you work, reserve some of the largest, nicest apple slices for the top layer; you'll need roughly 40 to 50 slices for it). Continue arranging apples in even layers until apples are 1/2 inch from top; press apples down to evenly distribute.

Arrange final layer of apples in horizontal, shingled pattern.

Scrape remaining batter into pan, making sure to leave 1/4 inch space from top; gently tap pan to knock out air pockets and distribute batter.

Set loaf pan on middle rack of oven and slide a rimmed baking sheet on the rack underneath to catch any drips. Bake until top is golden brown and domed and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center meets little resistance and comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes; rotate pan one time halfway through baking. Transfer cake to wire rack and cool for 10 minutes; loosen sides with butter knife or offset spatula. Cool cake in pan to about 140°F (60°C), about 2 hours. Then lift loaf using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Let cake cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour longer.

Meanwhile, for the Caramel: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water and sugar over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 5 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, about 1 minute longer.

Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low.

Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225°F (107°C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes.

Off heat, whisk in miso until smooth and combined. Transfer sauce to a heat-safe container.

To serve, using a serrated knife, cut cake into 1-inch thick slices and serve with warm or room temperature caramel.","Apple,Fall,French,Baked Fruit,Cakes",https://www.seriouseats.com/gateau-invisible

In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with salt and pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet.

Add split carrots, halved onions, and garlic to Dutch oven and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes; lower heat if browned bits on bottom of Dutch oven threaten to burn.

Add brandy, if using, and boil until alcohol has nearly cooked off, about 2 minutes. (If not using brandy, proceed with next step.)

Scrape chicken stock and all gelatin into Dutch oven. Add red wine, fish sauce, soy sauce, and bouquet garnis and bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain simmer. Meanwhile, cut beef into 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add flour and stir until beef is evenly coated in a floury paste. Add beef and any accumulated juices to Dutch oven. Transfer to oven, cover with lid partially open, and cook until beef is starting to become tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook lardons over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and lardons are lightly browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Transfer lardons to a plate with a slotted spoon.

Add mushrooms to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their liquid and browned, about 12 minutes; add oil as needed if pan becomes too dry. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Remove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard large pieces of carrot and onion. Discard bouquet garnis. Using a ladle, skim off and discard accumulated fat on surface. Add reserved lardons and sautéed carrots, onions, and mushrooms to stew, return to oven, and continue to cook, uncovered, until beef is tender, about 30 minutes longer.

Remove stew from oven. If serving right away, skim off any additional fat from surface. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. Allow to cool slightly before serving, then serve topped with parsley. If making ahead, cool down stew, then chill in refrigerator; remove solid fat cap from surface once fully chilled. Reheat stew on the stovetop or in a low oven.","Beef Mains,French,Braised & Stewed Beef,Beef Chuck,Winter Mains",https://www.seriouseats.com/beef-bourguignon-red-wine-stew-recipe
Pistachio Frosting Recipe,Stella Parks,East African Cuisines,"5 1/2 ounces egg yolk (shy 2/3 cup; 155g), from about 10 large eggs

5 1/4 ounces plain or lightly toasted sugar (about 3/4 cup; 145g); see note

1 ounce liqueur or amaro, such as Cardamaro, Maraschino, and rum, or just water (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)

1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight, or more to taste

16 ounces unsalted butter (4 sticks; 455g), softened to about 65°F (18°C)

Homemade pistachio paste to taste, up to 14 ounces (396g)","For a Stand Mixer With a Bowl-Lift Design: Tear off a long strip of foil and crumple it into a thick ring. Place it in the bottom of a 3-quart saucier or similarly large, wide pot, and fill with roughly 1 1/2 inches water. Place over high heat until bubbling-hot, then adjust the temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. In a stainless steel stand mixer bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar, Cardamaro or other liquid ingredient, and salt. Place bowl over steaming water, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg yolk syrup reaches 155°F (68°C). This should take only about 5 minutes; if the process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. Transfer bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.


For a Stand Mixer With a Tilt-Head Design: Fill a large pot with a few inches of water. Place over high heat until bubbling-hot. In a large heatproof glass or ceramic bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar, Cardamaro or other liquid ingredient, and salt. Set bowl over the steaming water, then cook, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg yolk syrup register 155°F (68°C); this should take no longer than 8 minutes; if the process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. Scrape mixture into stand mixer bowl and fit stand mixer with a whisk attachment.

Whip the egg yolk mixture at high speed until fluffy, stiff, and beginning to ball up around the whisk, about 8 minutes. With mixer still running, add butter a few tablespoons at a time, waiting only a second or two between additions. In the end, the buttercream should be thick, creamy, and soft but not runny, around 72°F (22°C). When the consistency has been properly adjusted (see troubleshooting guide below), begin whipping in the pistachio paste a few tablespoons at a time, to achieve the desired intensity of flavor. Additionally, the buttercream can be seasoned with additional salt or other extracts to taste.

Use buttercream right away or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out the air, and seal. Buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks and frozen for up to several months. (The main issue with longer storage in the freezer is odor absorption, not spoilage.) Rewarm to 72°F and re-whip before using.

Troubleshooting: If warmer than 74°F (23°C), the buttercream will be soft and loose; pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes and re-whip to help it thicken and cool. If colder than 68°F (20°C), the buttercream will be firm and dense, making it difficult to spread over cakes and slow to melt on the tongue, creating a greasy mouthfeel. To warm, briefly set over a pan of steaming water, just until you see the edges melting slightly, then re-whip to help it soften and warm. French buttercream can be fixed according to the same rules for Swiss buttercream.

Basic French Lentils Recipe | Cook the Book,Caroline Russock,East African Cuisines,"1 cup lentils du Puy

1 clove

1 small onion, peeled

1 medium carrot, trimmed, peeled, and cut into 4 to 6 pieces

1 celery stalk, trimmed, peeled, and cut into 4 to 6 pieces

1 garlic clove, smashed, peeled, and germ removed

1 bay leaf

3 1/2 cups chicken broth, vegetable broth, or water

1 tablespoon Cognac (optional)

1 shallot, finely chopped, rinsed, and patted dry (optional)

Freshly ground pepper","Put the lentils in a strainer and pick through them, discarding any bits of stone that might have escaped the packers; rinse under cold running water.

Turn the lentils into a medium saucepan, cover them with cold water, bring to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes; spill the lentils out into the strainer. Drain, rinse the lentils again, and rinse out the saucepan.

Press the clove into the onion and toss the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, and bay leaf into the pan. Pour in the broth or water, stir in the lentils, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a steady simmer and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are almost tender. As the lentils cook, skim off the solids that rise to the top and stir as needed. Season with salt and pepper and cook until they’re tender, another 5 to 10 minutes, then pour in the Cognac, if you’re using it. Give everything a good stir and another minute over the heat.

Drain the lentils, reserving the cooking liquid if you’re going to want to reheat them. Remove the vegetables and either discard them all or discard the clove and bay leaf and finely chop the vegetables, which will be soft but tasty. Stir the vegetables back into the lentils. If you’re using the shallot, stir it in now (I think it adds a lot to the mix).

The lentils are ready to be served now, set aside and reheated over low heat in the liquid you’ve reserved, or used in other recipes.

Storing: Once cooled, the lentils and their liquid can be packed airtight and kept chilled for up to 3 days. Warm in a covered saucepan over gentle heat.","Lentils,French",https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-french-lentils-recipe

Pommes Aligot (Cheesy Mashed Potatoes) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"1 1/2 pounds (675g) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks

2 medium cloves garlic, 1 whole and 1 minced, divided

2 sprigs thyme

Kosher salt

1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces; 115g), cut into tablespoon-size pieces

1 cup heavy cream (8 ounces; 235ml), plus more if needed

10 ounces (300g) mixed Alpine cheeses, such as Swiss, Gruyère, Comté, and/or Fontina, grated (see note)","In a large saucepan, cover potatoes and 1 whole clove garlic with cold water by at least 2 inches. Add thyme. Season water with salt until water is salty like tears. Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a knife easily pierces potatoes with no resistance, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander; discard thyme.

Using a ricer or a food mill fitted with the finest disk, purée potatoes back into saucepan, mixing butter cubes in as you go. (If using a food mill, you can add the butter to the potato chunks and work it through the mill; if using a ricer, add the butter to the saucepan with the riced potatoes.) Add remaining 1 clove minced garlic. Set saucepan over medium-low heat. Using a silicone spatula, stir potatoes well until butter and garlic are fully combined. (Alternatively, you can use a wooden spoon for this, though it won't conform to the sides of the pot like silicone will.)

Add cream and stir well until cream is fully incorporated. Continue stirring and working potatoes, lowering heat to low if potatoes begin to sizzle and steam, until potato mass feels thickened and sticky, about 3 minutes.

Add grated cheese in small batches, stirring between each addition until cheese is fully melted and incorporated. Continue stirring potatoes until they become thick, silky, smooth, and elastic (do not worry about overworking the potatoes in this recipe, since you want to develop that starch), about 3 minutes longer. The aligot should form long, stretchy strands when you lift it from the pot.

Season with salt. The aligot should be thick, with a very slow-flowing viscosity, like cooling lava; if too thick, work in additional cream in small amounts until it is loose enough.

Transfer to a warmed serving dish and serve right away. Aligot is traditionally served with sausages and meats, but you can also serve it with roasted vegetables or on a bed of polenta. Leftover aligot can be refrigerated in a sealed container. To reheat, add to a saucepan with a small amount of cream. Bring cream to a simmer before stirring it in, then continue to cook, adding more cream as necessary, until aligot is heated through and consistency is correct.","French,Gruyere,Heavy Cream,Yukon Gold Potatoes,Thanksgiving Side Dishes",https://www.seriouseats.com/pommes-aligot-french-cheese-mashed-potatoes-recipe
French Onion Soup Tarte Tatin Recipe,Sasha Marx,East African Cuisines,"1/2 batch Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough or 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed

3 medium yellow onions (about 1 1/2 pounds; 680g) (see note)

4 tablespoons (2 ounces; 56g) unsalted butter, softened, divided

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon (15ml) dry sherry (such as Amontillado)

3/4 cup (180ml) homemade chicken or beef stock, or store-bought, low-sodium chicken stock

1/4 teaspoon Asian fish sauce (optional)

1/4 teaspoon cider vinegar

1/2 teaspoon (2g) chopped fresh thyme leaves

1 tablespoon (15g) sugar

2 ounces (56g) Gruyère cheese, grated

2 tablespoons (30ml) Dijon mustard (optional)

Freshly sliced chives, for garnish","If using pie dough: Prepare Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 10-inch round. Transfer to a large, flat plate lined with parchment, or another similar arrangement. Working around circumference, fold 1/2 inch of dough over itself and pinch to create 9-inch round with raised rim. Cut three 2-inch slits in center of dough, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24. (If refrigerating overnight, cover dough with plastic.)


If using puff pastry: Roll puff pastry out so that you are able to cut a 10-inch round (you can use an inverted 10-inch skillet as a guide for cutting the round). Transfer to a large, flat plate lined with parchment, or another similar arrangement. Working around circumference, fold 1/2 inch of dough over itself and pinch to create 9-inch round with raised rim. Poke the pastry all over with a fork, and refrigerate until ready to use.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 400°F (204°C). Using a sharp knife, trim stem end of onions and halve onions from root end to stem end; peel and discard skin. For two of the onions, trim away the scraggly end of the root, while keeping the light-colored part intact, then cut each half into 4 wedges through the root end to keep wedges intact (giving you 16 wedges total). Set wedges aside. Thinly slice remaining onion.

In a 3-quart saucier or small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon (15g) butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add sliced onion, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently and adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water at a time when onions begin to stick and threaten to scorch, until onions are very sweet and a rich golden-brown color, about 15 minutes.

Add sherry, and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom and sides of the saucier. Add stock, bring to a simmer, and cook at a steady simmer until onions are jammy, and liquid has thickened and reduced to just coat the onions, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in fish sauce (if using), vinegar, and thyme. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, smear butter over bottom of 10-inch oven-safe skillet, sprinkle sugar in even layer over butter, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Arrange onion wedges in a tight circular pattern around edge of skillet, with root ends pointed inward toward center of skillet, making sure wedges are in even contact with skillet. Tuck remaining onion wedges into center of skillet.

Place skillet over high heat, and cook, without stirring, until onions have softened slightly and butter-sugar mixture has turned a dark amber color, 8 to 10 minutes. (Rotate skillet over burner as necessary to encourage even browning.) Reduce heat to medium, spoon caramelized onions into empty spaces between the onion wedges, and continue to cook for 1 minute longer. Turn off heat, and sprinkle Gruyère evenly over onions. Spread mustard evenly over prepared dough or pastry (if using), and carefully place round over onions (mustard-side down), making sure it is centered and not touching the sides of the skillet. Bake until crust is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer skillet to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let cool for 5 minutes.

Place a large plate over the skillet, carefully invert tart onto plate, then slide tart onto wire rack. Rearrange any onions pieces that may have shifted during unmolding, and let tart cool for 30 minutes. Cut into wedges, sprinkle with chives, and serve.","Savory,Vegetables,Fall Snacks & Appetizers,French,Onions",https://www.seriouseats.com/french-onion-soup-tarte-tatin

Toast for the marrow bones, if using

Mustard, grated horseradish, and cornichons, for condiments","In a large stockpot or Dutch oven, combine beef chuck, shank, short ribs, oxtail, thyme, onion, garlic, celery, peppercorns, and bay leaf. Top with enough cold water to just cover and season with a very generous pinch of salt.

Bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain a very gentle simmer. Cook, skimming occasionally, until each cut of beef is fork-tender, at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours, depending on the cut and animal your beef is from. If any piece of beef reaches tenderness before the others, simply transfer it to a large heatproof bowl, ladle a small amount of broth on top, and cover with plastic. Top up the pot with water as needed to keep all the ingredients covered.

When all the beef is done, strain the broth, discarding thyme, onion, celery, garlic, and peppercorns, and bay leaf. Return all the cuts of beef and broth to the pot.

Add potatoes, leeks, carrots, cabbage, turnip, parsnip, and marrow bones, if using, to stockpot, making sure all are submerged in the broth with the beef. Return to a gentle simmer and cook until all the vegetables are very tender and marrows bones are fully warmed through to the center, about 30 minutes.

Skim any fat from the broth. Transfer meats and vegetables to a platter, bathing with broth to keep moist. Season broth with salt. Serve broth as a soup, and the meats and vegetables as the main course; the marrow bones can be served with toasts (spread the marrow on the toasts and season with salt).

French Omelette With Cheese Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"3 large eggs

Kosher salt and freshly ground white or black pepper

1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter

1 ounce (30g) grated cheese, such as Gruyère, cheddar, or Swiss","In a medium bowl, beat eggs with a disposable plastic or reusable wooden fork just until last traces of white are mixed in; season with salt and pepper.

In a perfectly unscratched 8-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter, swirling over moderate heat, until fully melted and foamy but not browned. Add eggs and stir rapidly with fork, tines up, while shaking pan to agitate eggs; make sure to move fork all around pan to break up curds and scrape them from bottom of skillet as they form. Stop stirring as soon as eggs are very softly scrambled and creamy (but still loose enough to come together into a single mass), 1 to 2 minutes.

Using fork, gently spread egg in an even layer around skillet and scrape down any wispy bits around the edges. Scatter cheese all over egg. The top surface should be loose and creamy, but if it looks too liquid and raw, cook undisturbed for another few seconds. (If it still flows, you can swirl skillet to send loose egg to the edges, where it will set more quickly.)

Remove from heat, tilt skillet up by its handle, and, using fork, gently roll omelette down over itself until it is nearly folded in half. Using fork, push omelette to edge of skillet so that lower edge of egg begins to just barely overhang; use fork to fold overhanging edge of egg up, closing the omelette.

Hold skillet right over plate and turn omelette out onto it. It should be almond- or cigar-shaped, with the seam on bottom; if it's not, lay a clean kitchen towel over it and use your hands to adjust its shape and position, then remove towel. Serve.

1/4 cup candied lemon peel

3 tablespoons good dark rum

1 cup ground hazelnuts

1 cup ground almonds

1 tablespoon lebkuchen spice

1/4 teaspoon baking powder

2 eggs

3/4 cup brown sugar

A pinch of salt

24 baking wafers","Mix candied peel with rum and set aside to soak. Toss ground nuts with spices and baking powder and set aside.

Beat the eggs on high until pale yellow, about four minutes. Add sugar and salt, and beat on high five minutes more.

If very wet (though it likely won't be), drain the candied peel. Using a wooden spoon, fold the nut flour mixture and candied peels into the egg mixture until the flour is well incorporated, but do not over mix.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place rounded spoonfuls of the mixture on the parchment paper, making sure each cookie is at least 2 cm tall and leaving 3 – 4 cm between them. The cookies do not spread much in baking, so if you prefer perfectly smooth lebkuchen rather than craggy ones, it’s best to smooth them out by hand at this point. Optional: if using back-oblaten, form cookies directly on wafers, making sure that each cookie is about 2cm tall. Again, as the cookies don't spread in baking, cover the entire wafer.

Allow the cookies to rest for one hour at room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 150°C / 302°F. Bake cookies for 15-18 minutes, rotating pans halfway through, until the cookies are lightly browned, and spring back to the touch. (It’s better to air on the side of slight undercooking, as you want them to be moist and they dry out quickly.) Remove them from the oven and cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.

Store lebkuchen in an air tight container between layers of wax paper in the fridge. Cookies will keep, refrigerated, up to two weeks.

For an extra treat, dip them in chocolate, or glaze them with a thin sugar icing.","Cookies,German,Christmas Cookies",https://www.seriouseats.com/lebkuchen-spice-cookie-recipe
Duck à l'Orange Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"1 whole duck (about 5 pounds; 2.25kg)

Vegetable oil, for drizzling

Kosher salt

1 medium carrot, diced

1 medium yellow onion, diced

1 large celery rib, diced

2 quarts (2 liters) brown beef or brown chicken stock (see note)

1 tablespoon (15ml) tomato paste (optional)

4 ounces (115g) granulated sugar (about 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon)

1/2 cup red wine vinegar

Zest of 1 navel orange or 2 bitter oranges, cleaned of any white pith and cut into a fine julienne

2 tablespoons (30ml) fresh navel orange juice or 1/4 cup (60ml) bitter orange juice

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (omit if using bitter orange juice)

Freshly ground white or black pepper

2 tablespoons (30g) cold unsalted butter

Cornstarch or arrowroot (optional, only if needed)","If desired, you can spatchcock the duck (see note). To do so, use poultry shears to remove the backbone by cutting along both sides of the spine from the cavity to neck ends, then flip the duck and press down on the breast to flatten it.

Trim away any excess skin around the duck's neck and cavity openings. Cut off duck wingettes and wing tips at the joint, leaving the drumettes connected to the duck; remove neck and any giblets from the cavity. Refrigerate trimmed wing ends, neck, and spine (if using) until ready to make the sauce; reserve giblets and trimmed skin for another use, or discard.

Prick duck skin all over with a sharp paring knife, especially where the skin is thickest, being careful not to cut into the meat below. In a large pot of boiling water and while wearing heavy kitchen gloves to protect your hands from the heat, dip the duck into the water for 2 minutes. Remove, allowing boiling water to drain off before transferring duck, breast side up, to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet.

Season duck all over, inside and out, with kosher salt. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.

When ready to roast the duck and make the sauce, preheat oven to 425°F (220°C) and set rack in middle position. Set trimmed wings and neck (plus backbone, if you've spatchcocked the duck) on a rimmed baking sheet along with the diced carrot, onion, and celery and drizzle lightly with oil, rubbing to coat all over; if using tomato paste (it will help darken an overly white stock), rub it all over the duck and vegetables as well.

Roast duck trimmings and vegetables, stirring one or twice, until browned all over, about 25 minutes (check often, as you do not want anything to scorch or burn).

Add stock to a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Transfer roasted duck trimmings and vegetables to the stock. Pour some boiling water onto the baking sheet and scrape up any browned bits, then add that liquid to the stock, as well.

Gently simmer stock and vegetables until reduced by about half, about 2 hours (timing can vary wildly as evaporation rates depend on the pot dimensions and other factors, so keep an eye on it); occasionally skim off and discard any scum or rendered fat that accumulates on the surface.

Fine-strain stock and discard solids. Add stock to a smaller saucepan and continue to gently simmer until reduced to about 1 cup (225ml); continue to occasionally skim off any scum. Set aside.

Meanwhile, increase oven to 450°F (230°C). Roast duck (you can leave it on the wire rack set in the rimmed baking sheet) for 30 minutes; this can produce some smoke, so open your windows if necessary.

Reduce oven to 300°F (150°C) and continue to roast duck until an instant-read thermometer registers around 175°F in the thickest parts of the thigh and breast, about 45 minutes if the duck is spatchcocked and 1 hour if whole (it's okay if some parts of the duck get hotter, it's meant to be well done and will not harm the duck). Remove duck from oven and set aside to rest.

While duck is roasting, add sugar to a small saucepan. Add 1/4 cup water and set over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 6 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is a rich mahogany color, about 4 minutes longer.

Remove from heat and add vinegar in very small increments while carefully swirling the saucepan; the caramel will boil and bubble violently at first, so adding the vinegar in very small amounts at first will help prevent a boil-over. Once the gastrique has calmed down, you can add the remaining vinegar more quickly, swirling the whole time. Some of the caramel may seize up at first, but it will dissolve back into the solution on its own.

Return gastrique to medium heat and bring back to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a strong simmer and cook until it is very slightly reduced, about 2 minutes; stir, if needed, to dissolve any last traces of hardened sugar, then set aside.

In a clean small saucepan, bring about 1 cup of water to a rolling boil. Add orange zest and cook until softened, about 2 minutes for navel orange zest and 15 minutes for bitter orange zest. Drain and set blanched zest aside.

When ready to serve, return duck to oven just long enough to reheat and re-crisp the skin, 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how much it's cooled off.

Meanwhile, add navel orange and lemon juices (or bitter orange juice) to reduced stock and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently until reduced enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.

Add gastrique 1 teaspoon at a time until sauce tastes nicely sharp with a clear sweet-sour character. You want to taste the gastrique but not have it clobber the sauce; too much can ruin the sauce (you may only need a 2 to 4 teaspoons to accomplish this). You will have leftover gastrique, which you can reserve for another use (it can be drizzled on grilled or roasted vegetables or used in another sauce).

Season sauce with salt and pepper. Working over very low heat, whisk in butter until the sauce is silky and smooth; do not allow it to boil once the butter is added, lest the sauce break.

The sauce at this point should lightly coat the back of a spoon, and if you drag your finger through it, it should leave a clear path. If it doesn't, it may be too thin (a sign your stock didn't have enough gelatin in it originally). If this happens, add 1 or 2 teaspoons cornstarch or arrowroot to a small bowl and stir in a spoonful or two of the sauce to make a slurry with no lumps, then whisk that slurry back into the sauce, allowing it to gently simmer for a minute or two to thicken the sauce.

Add blanched zest and let very gently simmer for 1 minute to infuse into the sauce.

Carve duck and serve, spooning sauce on top or alongside.

Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are very sweet and a rich golden-brown color, 1 to 2 hours. If browned onion juices on bottom of pot threaten to burn, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) water, scrape up browned bits, and continue cooking. Season with salt and pepper.

Add sherry and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. (If using 2 skillets, divide sherry between them, then scrape onions and liquid from both pans into a pot or Dutch oven to continue.) Cook until alcohol smell is mostly gone, about 3 minutes. Add stock, thyme, and bay leaf; raise heat to medium-high; and bring to a simmer. Lower heat and simmer for 20 minutes.

Classic Mornay Sauce (Cheesy White Sauce) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 ounce; 20g)

1 1/2 tablespoons (12g) all-purpose flour

1 cup (240ml) whole milk

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste (optional)

2 ounces (55g) finely grated Swiss or Gruyère cheese","In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat (do not allow it to brown). Add flour and whisk to form a paste. Continue to cook, stirring, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, add milk in a thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pan to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.

Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper. Add nutmeg to taste, if using. If any lumps form, simply whisk thoroughly to remove them and smooth out sauce, or use a hand blender or countertop blender if lumps are particularly large or tough. Working in 2 or 3 additions, whisk in cheese, incorporating each addition just as the one before it is on the verge of fully melting; make sure to keep the heat low after the cheese goes in, as too much heat can cause the sauce to break. Remove from heat.

Use sauce right away, or press a piece of plastic wrap over surface of sauce to prevent a skin from forming and keep warm until ready to use. Sauce can be cooled and stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for several days.

Classic Steak au Poivre Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"4 (6- to 8-ounce; 170 to 225g) boneless medallion steaks, such as filet mignon

Kosher salt

1 ounce (30g) whole black peppercorns, plus more as needed, divided

3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil

1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter

2 thyme sprigs

1 medium clove garlic

1/2 large shallot (about 1 1/2 ounces; 40g), minced

2 tablespoons (30ml) brandy or cognac

3/4 cup (175ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth

3/4 cup (175ml) heavy cream or 6 tablespoons (90ml) crème fraîche (see note)

1 teaspoon (5ml) Dijon mustard","Season steaks all over with kosher salt. Set on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and allow to air-dry, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, crack peppercorns into rough halves and quarters. You can use a pepper mill set to its coarsest setting (though not all pepper mills will crack coarsely enough); a mortar and pestle (though some peppercorns will jump out as you try to crush them); or, perhaps best, a large mallet, meat pounder, or skillet to crush them (wrap the peppercorns in a clean kitchen towel first to contain them).

Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread cracked peppercorns on a plate or in another shallow dish and firmly press one side of each steak into the pepper to encrust it in an even layer. Set each steak aside, peppercorn side up. Reserve any remaining cracked peppercorns. (Exactly how much pepper adheres will depend on the dimensions of the steaks. You should have some pepper remaining, but if not, you can crack more to completely coat one side of each steak.)

In a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add steaks, peppercorn side down, and cook until peppercorns are well toasted, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn steaks, trying not to break the peppercorn crust. Add butter, thyme, and garlic and cook, basting steaks with a spoon, until steaks are well seared on the second side. Remove from heat.

Transfer steaks to a rimmed baking sheet. Using an instant-read thermometer, check the internal temperature of the steaks; if they've reached 125°F (52°C), they're ready to be served medium-rare. If they haven't reached their final doneness temperature (which will depend heavily on the dimensions of the steaks), transfer to oven and continue cooking until the correct internal temperature is reached. Either way, allow steaks to rest for 5 minutes once the final doneness temperature is reached.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from skillet and discard garlic and thyme. Add shallot and any reserved cracked peppercorns, return to medium heat, and cook, stirring, until shallot is tender, about 2 minutes.

Add brandy or cognac. (To prevent an unexpected flare-up if working over gas, you can turn off the burner, add the alcohol, then reignite the burner.) Cook until raw alcohol smell has burned off and brandy has almost completely evaporated.

Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Whisk in cream or crème fraîche, then simmer, stirring often, until sauce has reduced enough to glaze a spoon. Whisk in mustard. Season with salt.

Arrange steaks on plates and pour sauce on top. Serve with French fries, mashed potatoes, or other sides of your liking.","Europe,French",https://www.seriouseats.com/steak-au-poivre
Classic French Omelette Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"3 large eggs

Kosher salt and freshly ground white or black pepper

1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter","In a medium bowl, beat eggs with a disposable plastic or reusable wooden fork just until last traces of white are mixed in; season with salt and pepper.

In a perfectly unscratched 8-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter, swirling over moderate heat, until fully melted and foamy but not browned. Add eggs and stir rapidly with fork, tines up, while shaking pan to agitate eggs; make sure to move fork all around pan to break up curds and scrape them from bottom of skillet as they form. Stop stirring as soon as eggs are very softly scrambled and creamy (but still loose enough to come together into a single mass), 1 to 2 minutes.

Using fork, gently spread egg in an even layer around skillet and scrape down any wispy bits around the edges. The top surface should be loose and creamy, but if it looks too liquid and raw, cook undisturbed for another few seconds. (If it still flows, you can swirl skillet to send loose egg to the edges, where it will set more quickly.)

Remove from heat, tilt skillet up by its handle, and, using fork, gently roll omelette down over itself until it is nearly folded in half. Using fork, push omelette to edge of skillet so that lower edge of egg begins to just barely overhang; use fork to fold overhanging edge of egg up, closing omelette.

Hold skillet right over plate and turn omelette out onto it. It should be almond- or cigar-shaped, with the seam on bottom; if it's not, lay a clean kitchen towel over it and use your hands to adjust its shape and position, then remove towel. Serve. (To make another omelette, wipe any eggy bits out of skillet and repeat.)","Omelettes,French,Stovetop Eggs,Breakfast & Brunch,Mother's Day",https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-french-omelette-recipe
Belgian Tripel (For Beginning Homebrewers) Recipe,Joe Postma,East African Cuisines,"9 pounds Pilsner malt extract

1 pound light Belgian candy sugar

1 pound Carapils malt, crushed

2 ounces Hallertau hops - 60 minutes

6 gallons of tap water, split

2 Liter starter of liquid Belgian Ale yeast (Whitelabs WLP500 or Wyeast 1214)","If possible, place 3 gallons in the refrigerator to cool in a sanitized container.

Tie the Carapils malt in a large mesh grain bag or hop bag. Place the bag in 3 gallons of water in a 5 gallon pot and immerse the grain.

Begin to heat, making sure mesh bag isn’t sitting directly on the bottom of the pot. Remove the grain bag when the temperature reaches 170°.

Bring wort to a vigorous boil. As water is heating, slowly add 2 pounds of Pilsner liquid malt extract, stirring constantly until completely dissolved. When the boil begins, add 2 ounces Hallertau hops in a mesh bag.

After 45 minutes of boiling has passed, add remaining 7 pounds of Pilsner liquid malt extract and 1 pound of Belgian candy sugar, stirring constantly until completely dissolved.

After total of 60 minutes of boil, remove from heat. Warning: After wort cools below 180°F everything that touches it should be sanitary, and exposure to open air should be limited as much as possible.

Cool wort by placing pot in ice bath until it is below 85°F. Transfer to sanitized fermentor (either a carboy or a fermentation bucket). Top off to make 5 gallons using refrigerated water.

Use a sanitized auto-siphon racking cane to remove enough wort to take a gravity reading with your hydrometer. Make a note of this number, since you will be using it to calculate the actual alcohol content when it's done fermenting. The reading should be around 1.075.

Carefully pour yeast into cooled wort (it should be below 70°F), and agitate vigorously. Cover fermentor with a sanitized stopper and airlock. Ferment in dark place, keeping ambient temperature consistent, preferably between 68 and 70°F.

After primary fermentation is complete (take at least two consistent gravity readings), transfer to a secondary carboy for conditioning as discussed here and store as cool as possible.

Bottle after another four to six weeks using enough priming sugar for a high level of carbonation according to these instructions.","Beer,Belgian",https://www.seriouseats.com/homebrewing-belgian-tripel-recipe

8 ounces salt pork, cut into 3/4-inch cubes

6 to 8 pieces of chicken thighs and drumsticks, or 4 whole chicken leg quarters

Freshly ground black pepper

1 pound garlic sausage (2 to 4 links depending on size)

1 large onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)

1 carrot, unpeeled, cut into 3-inch sections

2 stalks celery, cut into 3-inch sections

1 whole head garlic

4 sprigs parsley

2 bay leaves

6 cloves","In a large bowl, cover beans with 3 quarts water and add 3 tablespoons salt. Stir to combine and let sit at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse beans and set aside.

Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 300°F. Place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. Set aside. Heat duck fat (if using) in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add salt pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. (If not using duck fat, cook pork with no additional fat.)

Season chicken pieces with pepper (do not add salt) and place skin side-down in now-empty pan. Cook without moving until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip chicken pieces and continue cooking until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with salt pork.

Add sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until well-browned on both sides. Transfer to bowl with salt pork and chicken. Drain all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot.

Add onions to pot and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cook until onions are translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add drained beans, carrot, celery, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, cloves, and stock/gelatin mixture. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce to low, cover Dutch oven and cook until beans are almost tender but retain a slight bite, about 45 minutes.

Using tongs, remove carrots, celery, parsley, bay leaves, and cloves and discard. Add meats to pot and stir to incorporate, making sure that the chicken pieces end up on top of the beans with the skin facing upwards. Beans should be almost completely submerged. Transfer to oven and cook, uncovered, until a thin crust forms on top, about 2 hours, adding more water by pouring it carefully down the side of the pot as necessary to keep beans mostly covered.

Break crust with a spoon and shake pot gently to redistribute. Return to oven and continue cooking, stopping to break and shake the crust every 30 minutes until you reach the 4 1/2 hour mark. Return to oven and continue cooking undisturbed until the crust is deep brown and thick, about 5 to 6 hours total.

Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring and scraping the sides and bottom of pan, until sauce is nicely thickened, about 3 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer béchamel sauce to large heatproof mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly.

Whisk Dijon mustard and/or cayenne/hot sauce (if using) into béchamel. Then, while whisking constantly, work in egg yolks one at a time until thoroughly blended. Set soufflé base aside.

In large mixing bowl, using a French whisk, electric hand blender, or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, combine egg whites with cream of tartar (if using) and beat until firm, glossy peaks form.

Add 1/3 of beaten egg whites to béchamel base and stir well until whitesare thoroughly combined and soufflé base has a looser consistency. Mix in Gruyère and then add remaining beaten whites. Using a silicon spatula, gently fold them into soufflé base just until well combined.

Remove soufflé dish from refrigerator and set on rimmed baking sheet. Scrape soufflé batter into prepared baking dish, filling it up to the inner ridge, not to the top (discard any excess). If desired, using an offset or other spatula, gently smooth and level surface of the soufflé batter.

Transfer soufflé to oven and bake until well risen and very nicely browned on top, about 30 minutes at 400°F for less set and 35 minute at 400°F for more set, and 35-40 minutes at 375°F for fully set.

Immediately transfer soufflé to table and serve before it deflates too much, scooping out portions onto each diner's plate.","French,Savory,Gruyere,Parmesan,Breakfast & Brunch",https://www.seriouseats.com/savory-cheese-souffle

1 cup golden raisins

1 bay leaf

1 teaspoon fresh or dried thyme

3/4 cup homemade beef or chicken stock or prepared low-sodium beef or chicken stock

For the pretzel dumplings:

1 cup whole milk

6 day-old soft pretzels,* about 2 ounces each, sliced 1/8-inch thick

Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper

3 to 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided

1 medium Spanish onion, finely diced

1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

1 large egg, lightly beaten

Note: Buy soft pretzels in your supermarket's freezer section. Bake them one day, then use them to make the dumplings the next day.

For the sweet-and-sour cabbage:

5 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup diced red onion

1 medium white onion, diced

2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into small dice

1 large red cabbage, about 3 pounds, cored and sliced thin

2/3 cup dried cherries

1 1/2 cups dry red wine

2 whole cloves

1/3 cup brown sugar

1 bay leaf

1/8 cup apple cider vinegar

Freshly squeezed juice of 1/2 lemon","To make the sauerbraten, place the brisket in a deep pan or Dutch oven. Add the wine, vinegar, juniper berries, peppercorns, celery, carrots, leek, garlic, and 1 of the sliced onions. The brisket should be completely submerged. Cover and refrigerate for 4 days. Turn the meat once each day. After four days, remove the meat from the marinade and pat it dry. Strain and reserve the marinade.

Preheat the oven to 275°F. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the brisket and brown it on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the meat, leaving the fat in the pan, and season with salt and pepper. Add the 2 remaining sliced onions. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and caramelized, about 15 minutes.

Deglaze the pan by adding the reserved marinade and scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Add the apples, raisins, bay leaf, and thyme and stir to combine. Return the meat to the pan with any accumulated juices and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Braise for 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is very tender, turning the meat halfway through.

Prepare the pretzel dumplings while the meat is braising. Warm the milk in a small saucepan over low heat. Place the pretzels in a large bowl and pour the warm milk over the top. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the pretzels soak for 30 minutes.

In a sauté pan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until translucent. Season with salt and remove from the heat. Stir in the parsley, then add the seasoned onion to the dumpling mixture and, using your hands, mix to combine.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Add the egg to the dumpling mixture and incorporate well. Using your hands, squeeze the mixture through your fingers to break it up. With slightly wet hands, form 3 smooth logs that are 2 inches across.


Wrap each log in plastic wrap and twist the ends to secure them. Then wrap them in aluminum foil and secure the ends. Drop the logs into the boiling water. Return to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Remove from the water, open the foil and plastic wrap to allow the logs to cool.

Meanwhile, prepare the cabbage. In a Dutch oven or large skillet fitted with a lid, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and apples and sauté until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cabbage, cherries, red wine, cloves, brown sugar, and bay leaf, stirring to combine. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil.

Cover the pan, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the cider vinegar and lemon juice. Cook for 1 minute.

When the brisket is tender, transfer it to a cutting board. Add the stock to the Dutch oven and reduce over medium heat, until the sauce is reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Slice the brisket against the grain and return to the pot with the sauce. Keep warm.

To finish the pretzel dumplings, discard the foil and plastic wrap and cut the logs into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Working in batches and using


more butter as needed, add the sliced dumplings to the pan and sauté until golden, 1 or 2 minutes. Turn and cook for 1 minute more.

To serve, place a cup of braised red cabbage on each of 6 plates and top with 3 slices of brisket. Spoon the sauce over the meat and serve with 3 pretzel dumplings on the side.","Beef Mains,German,Cabbage",https://www.seriouseats.com/beef-sauerbraten-with-red-cabbage-pretzel-dumplings-recipe

8 crushed cardamom pods, or 1/2 teaspoon ground

1 teaspoon of fenugreek, whole or ground

1 teaspoon of coriander, whole or ground

2 cloves, or 1/8 teaspoon ground

2 bay leaves","In a saucepan, slowly melt the butter on low heat. Meanwhile, toast the spices. If grinding, toast beforehand.

Add all the spices to the butter, and reduce the heat to a bare simmer. Keep an eye on the pot every few minutes to make sure it’s not boiling as the water evaporates. The milk solids will rise to the surface of the pot as the water cooks out.

Let the butter simmer, with just a few bubbles popping through, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Like a good stock, longer cooking is better, but it needs to be gentle so the milk solids don’t burn. If they do, the niter kibbeh will be irreparably bitter.

When the solids have turned a pleasant brown and plenty of time has past, line a mesh strainer with a cheesecloth or paper towel and place it over a small storage container. Strain the butter well, making sure there are no milk solids or spices in the final product. Your niter kibbeh will last for months in the refrigerator.

Using a potato masher, food mill, or ricer, mash potatoes with butter. Press surface smooth, then press plastic wrap directly against surface to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside until ready to assemble.

Meanwhile, for the Meat Sauce: Place stock in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, sprinkle with gelatin, and set aside.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add half of ground meat and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes; use a potato masher or large whisk to break up meat. Add remaining meat and cook, breaking up with masher or whisk, until reduced to small bits, about 3 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent scorching. If meat has rendered an excessive amount of fat, use a metal spoon to ladle most of it out, leaving just a few tablespoons in the pot. Add onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until just beginning to soften slightly, about 4 minutes.

Add tomato paste and cook over medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Add red wine and bring to a simmer over high heat. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until almost fully evaporated. Add reserved chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf, Worcestershire, and Marmite, if using. Sprinkle flour over ground meat in pot, then stir in. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is reduced and thick, about 20 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Stir in peas and season with salt and pepper.

To Assemble and Bake: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Before assembling, heat cream in a large saucepan until simmering. Add potatoes and stir gently until completely incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Potatoes are now ready for assembly.

Set a 9- by 13-inch baking dish on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Add meat sauce, being careful not to fill more than halfway. (You might not need all of the sauce, depending on the exact size of your baking dish.) Top with mashed potatoes, spreading them with a spatula to cover surface completely. Using spatula, create a dappled pattern on top of potatoes. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if using.

Transfer to oven and bake until top is browned and casserole is fully heated through, about 20 minutes. For deeper browning, place casserole on a rack set about 6 inches under a hot broiler for the last few moments of cooking. (Monitor closely to prevent potatoes from burning.)

Let stand 15 to 20 minutes before serving. Casserole can be assembled, wrapped with plastic, and refrigerated up to 2 days. Reheat in a 350°F oven for about 35 minutes, then use broiler to brown top.","British,Ground Beef,Ground Lamb,Peas,Russet Potatoes",https://www.seriouseats.com/shepherds-pie-beef-lamb-recipe

2 teaspoons salt

3 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting

Vegetable oil

1 1/2 pounds breakfast sausage links","Place the 2/3 cup milk and water in a microwave safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds; the mixture should be lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast and sugar over the warmed milk mixture and let sit until frothy, about 3 minutes.

Sift the salt with the flour into a large bowl. Gently mix the yeast mixture with a fork, then pour over flour; mix with a wooden spoon until dough forms, then knead the dough lightly with your hands. Form the dough into a ball and place into an oiled bowl. Cover with a tea towel and let the dough double in size, about 90 minutes.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 425°F. Punch down the dough and divide it into 8 portions. Form these into ovals, and set them on the baking sheet, leaving as much room as possible between them. Cover with plastic wrap, making sure that the wrap is touching the dough to prevent a skin from forming. Let rise for an additional 15 minutes.

Remove plastic wrap, then brush tops and sides of the baps with remaining tablespoon milk, and sprinkle with flour. Bake until baps are puffed and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a rack. Baps are best the day they are made but can be stored in a plastic bag or covered container at room temperature for up to two days. Reheat in a 350° oven for 5 minutes to refresh. Use baps for sandwiches.","Sandwiches,British,Sausages,Breakfast Sandwich",https://www.seriouseats.com/traditional-british-baps-recipe

Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cubed butter in the bowl of a food processor. Process until butter virtually disappears into a fine, floury meal. Add buttermilk and pulse to form a damp and crumbly dough. Turn onto an unfloured surface and knead into a ball.

Roll and Bake the Biscuits: On a generously floured surface, roll dough until just shy of 1/4 inch (4.7mm), using as much flour as needed along the way to prevent sticking. Dust away excess flour with a pastry brush and decorate with a docking tool if you like. Cut into 2 3/4–inch rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Gather up scraps, knead, roll, and cut as before.

Bake until firm to the touch and light brown all over, about 18 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pan and continue with next step, or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.

Temper the Chocolate: Temper chocolate according to one of the methods described here.

Coat the Biscuits: Working with just 2 or 3 biscuits at a time, dollop a generous 1/2 tablespoon, or just over 1/4 ounce, chocolate over each. Spread into an even layer over biscuit and, as chocolate starts to thicken, bounce the tines of a fork across the surface to create a wavy pattern. Repeat with remaining biscuits and chocolate. (Before it hardens, store excess chocolate according to the directions here.)

2g kosher salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)

100ml beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil (about 1/2 cup)","Combine eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, for best results, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate batter overnight or for up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while you preheat the oven.

Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly between two 8-inch cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets, two 6-well popover tins (see note), one 12-well standard muffin tin, or one 24-well mini muffin tin. Preheat in the oven until the fat is smoking hot, about 10 minutes.

Transfer the pans or tins to a heat-proof surface (such as an aluminum baking sheet on your stovetop), and divide the batter evenly between every well (or between the two pans if using pans). The wells should be filled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (if using pans, they should be filled about 1/4 of the way). Immediately return to oven.

2 tablespoons prepared horseradish

1 tablespoon dijon, spicy brown, or hot English mustard

1 pound mushrooms (button, cremini, shiitake, portabello, or a mix) cleaned, trimmed, and roughly chopped

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 medium shallots, finely sliced (about 1/2 cup)

2 teaspoons finely minced fresh thyme leaves

1/2 cup cognac or other brandy or barrel-aged spirit such as bourbon

1/2 cup heavy cream

2 teaspoons soy sauce

4 ounces fresh foie gras (about two 1/2-inch slabs, see note)

1 sheet fillo dough

1/4 pound prosciutto, sliced paper thin

Flour for dusting

14 ounces frozen or homemade puff pastry, thawed (see note)

1 egg, beaten

Coarse sea salt, such as Maldon or fleur de sel

1 bunch finely minced chives","Using butcher's twine, tie tenderloin at 1-inch intervals. Trim ends of twine. Season liberally with salt and pepper.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until smoking. Add tenderloin and cook without moving until well-browned on first side, about 2 minutes. Rotate tenderloin and continue cooking until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a large plate.

Combine horseradish, mustard, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl. When tenderloin is cool enough to handle, cut off and discard twine, then rub on all surfaces with horseradish/mustard mixture. Place in refrigerator, uncovered.

Place half the mushrooms in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until very finely chopped, scraping down sides and redistributing mushrooms with spatula as necessary, about 10 short pulses. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with remaining mushrooms.

Heat butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have exuded all their liquid and start to sizzle, about 8 minutes. Continue cooking until mushrooms begin to brown and leave browned bits stuck to bottom of pan, about 4 minutes longer. Add shallots and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 2 minutes.

Add brandy. Scrape bottom of skillet with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to release browned bits. Continue to cook until brandy is nearly dry, about 4 minutes. Add heavy cream and soy sauce and continue to cook, stirring frequently until mixture is thick and collects in one large mass when you shake the skillet. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and place in the refrigerator.

Season foie gras liberally with salt and pepper. Heat remaining half teaspoon oil in a small cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until smoking. Add foie gras and cook without moving until well browned on first side, about 30 seconds. Carefully flip with a small offset spatula and brown second side, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer foie gras to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour rendered fat into mushroom mixture, stir to combine, and return to refrigerator. Use a sharp knife to split each piece of cooked foie gras in half horizontally. Transfer to a plate and place in refrigerator. Allow all ingredients to chill for at least 30 minutes.

Lay a double layer of plastic wrap about 2 feet long and 1 food wide on your cutting board. Lay fillo dough on top of plastic wrap. Shingle prosciutto on top of fillo to create a thin, even, overlapping layer, leaving a 2-inch border along the bottom and top of the fillo dough. Spread mushroom mixture evenly over ham layer.

Place tenderloin along the very bottom edge of the ham/mushroom layer. Spread sliced foie gras evenly over top of tenderloin (see note). Carefully roll tenderloin in mushroom, ham, and fillo, using the plastic wrap to help tighten it as you roll. Once beef is completely rolled up, re-wrap with more plastic wrap, twisting the ends to make sure roll is very tight. Return to refrigerator.

Dust board or countertop lightly with flour. Spread puff pastry on board and, using a rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle at least 4-inches wider than the beef roll on its shorter side.

Unwrap beef roll and place along very bottom edge of puff pastry with the foie gras side facing up. Brush 6 inches of puff pastry just above beef roll with beaten egg. Carefully roll the beef in the puff pastry until it is completely wrapped. You should end up with the foie gras-side facing up again, with the puff pastry seam meeting on the bottom. Trim pastry with a sharp knife.

Fold sides of puff pastry protruding from either end of the beef roll towards the center, then fold the top flaps down. Trimm off the bottom flaps carefully.

Roll entire beef roll over so that the bottom is facing up, then fold up the end flaps to seal completely. Roll beef back right-side up. Transfer to a plate and chill for at least 30 minutes.

Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Transfer Wellington to a foil-lined baking sheet and brush all over with beaten egg. Use a sharp paring knife to score a decorative pattern in the pastry. Sprinkle liberally with coarse sea salt. Bake until pastry is golden brown and center of roast registers 110°F (43°C)for rare or 120°F (49°C) for medium-rare on an instant-read thermometer, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest for ten minutes.

Use a thin metal spatula to loosen Wellington from foil, then carefully transfer to a carving board. Slice off the ends with a sharp knife.

The Nasty Bits: How to Render Leaf Lard (with Welsh Griddle Cakes Recipe),Chichi Wang,East African Cuisines,"4 cups cake flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup cold unsalted butter

1/2 cup rendered lard, in its solid form

3/4 cup granulated sugar plus more for sprinkling

1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

3/4 cup golden raisins, currants, or dried cranberries

Finely grated zest of 1 large lemon

1 large egg

3 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice

3 Tablespoons whole milk, plus more if needed

All purpose flour, for rolling dough

For the rendered lard:

1 entire leaf lard, about 2 1/2 pounds

1/4 cup water","In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the lard and butter, or just the butter, and using a pastry blender, or two knives, cut the fat into the flour until the particles are the size of small peas. Using your fingertips, rub the flour and fat mixture until the lard and the butter are fairly small and the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in the sugar, nutmeg, allspice, the dried fruit, and lemon rind.

In a small bowl with a fork, beat the egg, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of milk. Sprinkle the egg mixture over the flour mixture and use the fork to start stirring it in, tossing the dough until it forms medium clumps. Then reach into the dough with both hands and, working quickly, keep tossing it until it feels moist, squeezing the dough together to form one mass. If the dough won't hold together, add a bit more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time.

Lightly flour your work surface, place the dough on it, and roll over the dough to flatten it; continue rolling until it is 1/3-inch thick. Use the cutter to stamp out rounds. Transfer them to the sheet or tray. Reroll and restamp the scraps, using all the dough.

Heat a cast-iron skillet over low heat. Carefully transfer the cakes to the skillet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Cook over low heat for 5 to 6 minutes or until the bottoms are deep golden brown. Turn over carefully with a spatula turner and cook the second sides for 5 more minutes. The surfaces should feel crisp when tapped.

Transfer the cakes to a wire rack. Cook the remaining cakes in the same way. Serve the cakes warm or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days.

For the rendered lard: (makes about 10 cups)

With a sharp knife, cut the lard into approximately 1 inch cubes.

Place the cubes of lard into a heavy pot, preferably enameled cast iron and add the water. Cover the pot and let the lard render for an initial ten minutes; then remove the lid. Maintaining the very low heat, slowly bring the lard to a temperature at which the liquid is barely simmering. Continue to render the lard for 1 to 2 hours, until the bits of cracklings are golden brown and very small, and the liquid fat is pale and golden.

Strain the cracklings from the lard, pressing down on the mesh of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible from the solids. Set aside the cracklings for another use. Cool the lard to room temperature and refrigerate until solid. The lard may be kept in airtight containers for several months.","Stovetop Guides,Northern European,Lard",https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-render-leaf-lard-welsh-griddle-cakes-recipe

Roll and Bake the Biscuits: On a generously floured surface, roll dough until just shy of 1/4 inch (4.7mm), using as much flour as needed along the way to prevent sticking. Dust away excess flour with a pastry brush and decorate with a docking tool if you like. Cut into 2 3/4–inch rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Gather up scraps, knead, roll, and cut as before.

Bake until firm and dry to the touch but quite pale, about 22 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pan and continue with next step, or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.

Temper the Chocolate: Temper chocolate according to one of the methods described here.

Coat the Biscuits: Working with just 2 or 3 biscuits at a time, dollop a generous 1/2 tablespoon, or just over 1/4 ounce, chocolate over each. Spread into an even layer over biscuit and, as chocolate starts to thicken, bounce the tines of a fork across the surface to create a wavy pattern. Repeat with remaining biscuits and chocolate. (Before it hardens, store excess chocolate according to the directions here.) Serve biscuits immediately, preferably with hot tea, and transfer to an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature.","Scottish,Dairy-free,Vegan Desserts,Baking,Chocolate",https://www.seriouseats.com/vegan-digestive-biscuits-diy-mcvities-recipe

5 tablespoons (75g) unsalted butter, divided

1 medium onion, minced or grated, divided (see note)

1 pound 4 ounces (560g) ground beef chuck (about 20% fat)

12 ounces (340g) ground pork (about 25% fat)

4 teaspoons (18g) kosher salt, plus more for seasoning

2 large eggs

1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, plus more for seasoning

1/8 teaspoon ground allspice

Canola or vegetable oil, for frying

3 tablespoons (45g) flour

2 cups (480ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth

1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce

1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Minced flat-leaf parsley, to garnish

Buttered boiled Yukon Gold potatoes and lingonberry jam, for serving (optional)","In a medium bowl, combine bread with milk, tossing to coat. Let stand until bread is completely softened and most of the milk has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt 2 tablespoons (30g) butter over medium-high heat. Add half of minced onion and cook, stirring, until onion is golden and tender, about 7 minutes.

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a food processor, combine ground beef, ground pork, soaked bread and any remaining milk, cooked onion, remaining raw onion, 4 teaspoons salt, eggs, white pepper, and allspice. Starting on low speed and increasing to medium-high, beat mixture until ingredients are thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dipping your hands in water as needed to prevent meatball mixture from sticking, roll roughly tablespoon-sized portions of meatball mixture into balls slightly smaller than golf-ball size. Transfer to lined baking sheet.

Set a rack over a clean baking sheet and heat oven to 200°F (90°C). Heat about 1/2 inch oil in a wide skillet to 350°F (177°C). Working in batches, lower meatballs into oil and fry, turning until well browned all over, about 2 minutes. Transfer browned meatballs to rack and keep warm in the oven.

In a medium saucepan, melt remaining 3 tablespoons (45g) butter over medium-high heat until foamy. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking, until raw flour smell is gone, about 3 minutes. Whisk in chicken stock, bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 3 minutes. Whisk in soy sauce and cider vinegar. Season with salt and white pepper.

2 tablespoons (30g) mascarpone cheese (optional)

3 tablespoons (45ml) Scotch whisky (see note)

2 tablespoons (30ml) honey, plus more for drizzling","Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). In a medium bowl, combine cream with oats and let soak 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, crush 8 ounces of the raspberries with a spoon to make a pulpy puree. Stir in lemon juice. Set remaining 4 ounces whole raspberries aside.

Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain oats, collecting the cream in a bowl; use a spoon or rubber spatula to press out as much cream as possible. Set cream aside.

In a small oven-safe skillet or on an aluminum baking sheet, stir soaked oats with melted butter and toast in oven, tossing and stirring frequently, until deeply browned, about 20 minutes (you want the oats to darken nearly to the point of being burnt, but don't actually burn them).

Strain oats on paper towels, and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt.

For a More Dense, Mousse-Like Cream: In a food processor, combine reserved cream with mascarpone (if using), Scotch, and honey, along with a pinch of salt. Process until a dense whipped cream forms.

For a More Standard, Lighter Whipped Cream: In a stand mixer fitter with the whisk, or using electric beaters or a hand whisk, combine reserved cream with mascarpone (if using), Scotch, and honey, along with a pinch of salt. Beat until a stiff whipped cream forms.

To Assemble: In individual serving glasses, spread an even layer of whipped cream. Top with a layer of the raspberry purée. Sprinkle some toasted oats on top, then add one more layer of the whipped cream to fill (or nearly fill) the glasses. Garnish each with the reserved whole raspberries, sprinkle additional toasted oats on top, and drizzle with honey.

Classic Pulpo Gallego (Galician Octopus Tapa) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,East African Cuisines,"1 (2 1/2-pound; 1kg) whole octopus, rinsed well (including inside head cavity)

1 medium yellow onion, peeled and halved (optional)

3 medium cloves garlic (optional)

Kosher salt (see note)

Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling

Pimentón dulce (sweet smoked Spanish paprika), to taste (see note)","If Using a Pressure Cooker: Place octopus in pressure cooker and add just enough water to cover. (Be sure to keep water level below pressure cooker's maximum fill line.) Add onion and garlic, if using, along with a couple of large pinches of salt. Close pressure cooker and bring to high pressure (12 to 15 psi). Once cooker has reached high pressure, cook for 15 minutes.

Using steam-release valve, depressurize cooker rapidly. Check octopus for tenderness by sliding a paring knife into the thickest part of one of its tentacles; it should slide in easily with little resistance. If octopus is not tender enough, return to high pressure and cook for 5 minutes longer. (Fifteen minutes was the correct time based on all our tests, but variations in the octopus, such as size, and in the pressure cooker used may change the cooking time slightly.) Let octopus cool slightly in its cooking liquid, then drain and discard onion and garlic. Continue with step 4.

If Using a Conventional Pot: Place octopus in a large pot and add enough water to cover by at least 2 inches. Add onion and garlic, if using, along with a couple of large pinches of salt. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then lower heat and continue to simmer until octopus is tender (a paring knife should slide into the thickest part of one of its tentacles easily), 1 to 2 hours. Let octopus cool slightly in its cooking liquid, then drain and discard onion and garlic.

To Serve: Cut out and discard the hard beak (if it hasn't been removed already by the fishmonger), which is found in the center of the base of the octopus body, where the tentacles converge. Cut out and discard the section of the head with eyes; the rest of the head is edible. Separate tentacles into individual pieces.

Cut tentacles crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds and head into small strips. Arrange on a plate in a single layer. Sprinkle salt all over, drizzle with olive oil, and dust with smoked paprika to taste.

2 medium ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped

1/4 cup (60 ml) dry white wine

1/2 teaspoon Spanish pimenton dulce (sweet paprika)

1 small pinch saffron threads, dry-toasted and ground (see note)

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Dense country bread, preferably one or two days old, for garnishing","Rinse all the fish and put them in a large stock or soup pot. Add half of the leeks, half of the onions, and the celery; cover with 8 cups/2 L water, and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently boil for 20 minutes, until the essence of the sea has been poached from the fish. Strain, reserving the liquid. Remove the bream and any larger fish; skin, debone, and flake the meat. Set aside. Discard the vegetables and remaining fish

In a deep cazuela, Dutch oven, or large, heavy pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat and prepare a sofrito: Add the remaining leeks and onions and cook until they are pale and tender, about 8 minutes. Add the carrot and cook until it has softened somewhat and turned a yellowish orange color, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until pulpy and darker red, about 10 minutes, adding in a few tablespoons of simmering stock from time to time to keep it moist. Add the wine and cook for 2 minutes to burn off the alcohol. Stir in 1 cup/240 ml of the reserved stock, lower the heat, and simmer until the carrot is very tender and the sauce has concentrated down, about 15 minutes. Pass the sauce through a food mill and return it to the pan.

Stir in the remaining 7 cups/1.76 L reserved stock. Add the pimentón and saffron and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.

Remove the pot from the heat and sprinkle the reserved flaked fish into the pot. Cover the pot for 1 to 2 minutes before ladling the soup into bowls and serving with the toast.

Note: To dry toast the saffron, heat a small ungreased skillet over medium-low heat, add the saffron threads, and toast for 2 to 3 minutes, or until aromatic and the threads have turned a shade darker in color. Place the toasted threads in a small sheet of paper that has been folded in half, crumble with your fingers—be sure they are dry—from the outside, and then shake the saffron from the paper into the dish (this prevents any saffron from sticking to your fingers).

1 pinch saffron threads, dry-toasted and ground

1 teaspoon Spanish pimentón dulche (sweet paprika)

7 cups (1.7 L) fish stock or water

3 cups (600 g) Bomba rice or another short- or medium-grain Spanish rice (see note)","Purge the clams of any sand: Discard any clams with cracked or broken shells. Fill a large bowl with cool water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt for every 1 quart/1 L water and dissolve. Set the clams in the water and soak for 30 minutes. Dump out the water, rinse out the bowl, and soak for another 30 minutes in clean, unsalted water. Drain, set in a dry bowl, cover with a damp paper towel, and place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes or so before using.

In a saucepan, add the clams, cover with 1 cup/240 ml water, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and cook, shaking from time to time, until the clams have opened, about 5 minutes. Transfer the clams to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Filter the liquid and reserve. Discard any clams that did not open. Twist off the empty half of each clam and discard.

Steam the mussels: Place them in a saucepan with 1⁄2 cup/60 ml water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat, cover the pot, and simmer, shaking the pot from time to time, until the mussels have opened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Drain, reserving the liquid. (Strain and set aside.) Discard any mussels that did not open. Remove the meat from each shell; discard the shells.

In a 16- to 18-inch/40- to 45-cm paella pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the langoustines and cook, turning over until pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter. Add the green peppers and cuttlefish and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, turning over once, until opaque, 4 to 5 minutes. (Remove any stray legs or antennae from the pan and discard.) Add the tomatoes and cook until soft and pulpy, about 10 minutes. Tip in some of the reserved liquid from the clams to keep it moist. Stir in the saffron and pimentón.

Pour the stock into the pan and bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. When the liquid comes to a boil, sprinkle the rice around the pan. With a wooden spoon, check that the rice is evenly distributed and that the grains are below the surface of the liquid. Do not stir again.

Cook uncovered for 10 minutes over high heat. Arrange the reserved langoustines across the top of the rice. Reduce the heat to low and cook uncovered for 8 to 10 minutes more, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice grains are tender but still have an al dente bite to them. If all the liquid has evaporated and the rice is still not done, shake the reserved liquid from the clams (and, if needed, from the mussels) tablespoon by tablespoon over the rice where needed and cook for an additional few minutes.

Remove the paella from the heat, cross wooden spoons over top, cover with paper towels, and let rest for 5 minutes to allow the rice—particularly the grains on top—to finish cooking and the starches to firm up.

Carry the paella to the table and serve from the pan.

Note: Spanish Bomba rice is a highly absorbent short-grain Spanish variety. It is found at many supermarkets with a decent international section, as well as numerous specialty stores. The best substitute is the Italian rice Carnaroli. Alternatively use CalRiso, Calrose, or Japanese short-grain rice. For moister rice dishes (but not paellas), use the superfine-grade Italian varieties such as Arborio or Vialone Nano.","Spanish,Dairy-free Mains,Gluten-free Mains,Stovetop Seafood,White Rice",https://www.seriouseats.com/shellfish-paella-paella-de-marisco-from-spain

Salt

1/2 cup (110 g) butter, cut into pieces

1 medium onion, very finely chopped

3 cups (720 ml) whole milk

Freshly ground black pepper

Pinch freshly grated nutmeg

1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

2 eggs

1 cup (140 g) fine breadcrumbs

Sunflower oil or mild olive oil for frying","In a skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and sauté until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter to cool. Cut the chicken into pieces and grind with a food processor.

In a clean skillet or sauté pan, melt the butter over medium heat and add the onion. Cook over medium-low heat, until soft and transparent but not yet browned, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer; season with salt, pepper, and the nutmeg. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and keep hot.

Sift the flour into the skillet over the onion and cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. It should be a compact and just-moist ball. Spread out the ball in the pan and begin slowly stirring in the hot milk until the mixture is creamy and not too sticky when touched, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and fold in the ground chicken. Cook, gently stirring, for 2 minutes. The mixture should be spongy and can be touched without sticking to your finger.

Transfer the mixture to a large bowl to cool. Once cool, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours until chilled. (This will make forming the croquettes easier.)

On a flat work surface dusted with flour, form croquettes into 2- to 2 1/2-inch (5- to 6.25-cm) long cylinders about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Lightly roll in flour.

Break the eggs in a bowl and thoroughly whisk. Place the breadcrumbs in a second bowl.

Dip the croquettes in the egg and roll in breadcrumbs to completely cover.

In a skillet or sauté pan, heat at least 3/4 inch/2 cm of sunflower oil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low.

Working in small batches that don’t crowd the pan, fry the croquettes, turning frequently, until they are golden on the outside and hot and creamy at the center, about 2 minutes. Gently transfer them to absorbent paper towels to drain off excess oil. Serve hot.

Notes: To freeze, roll the uncooked croquettes in egg and breadcrumbs and freeze in batches. Take them from the freezer and fry directly, without thawing.


When frying various batches in a skillet, breadcrumbs gather in the bottom and burn. These tend to stick to the new batch and leave a bitter taste. After two batches, very carefully filter the oil into a new skillet, bring it back to the correct temperature, and then continue frying.","Snacks & Appetizers,Spanish,Fried Chicken,Chicken",https://www.seriouseats.com/chicken-croquettes-croquetas-de-pollo-from-sp

"Sous Vide Shrimp With Garlic, Sherry, and Smoked Paprika Recipe",J. Kenji López-Alt,East African Cuisines,"1 1/2 pounds large peeled shrimp (about 700g) (see note)

Kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil

6 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced

1 tablespoon sweet smoked Spanish paprika (about 6g)

2 bay leaves

3 tablespoons (45ml) sherry

1 1/2 teaspoons (6ml) sherry vinegar

2 tablespoons (30g) butter

Crusty bread, for serving","Set your sous vide water bath to desired temperature according to the chart above.

In a large bowl, toss shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and the baking soda. Set aside.

Heat olive oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until garlic sizzles and softens but is not browned, about 3 minutes. Add paprika and bay leaves and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sherry and sherry vinegar, increase heat to high, and cook until the liquid is reduced and sauce starts to emulsify, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter. Season to taste with salt. Let cool about 5 minutes.

Place shrimp in a heavy duty zipper-lock bag or a vacuum bag. Pour in oil/garlic mixture. Remove all air from bag using the water displacement method or a vacuum sealer. Press shrimp into a single layer.

Add bagged shrimp to preheated water bath and cook for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour (the texture should show very little variation within this time frame).

Pour cooked shrimp and sauce into a warm bowl and serve. Alternatively, preheat a cast iron skillet over high heat until a bead of water dropped in sizzles immediately. Place on a trivet and pour in the shrimp/oil mixture. Serve immediately, passing bread for sopping up the extra sauce.

Torrijas Caramelizadas (Spanish-Style Caramelized French Toast) Recipe,Sasha Marx,East African Cuisines,"11 ounces (320g) pullman or brioche bread (about one-third to one-half of a loaf)

1 1/2 cups (375ml) whole milk

1 cinnamon stick or pinch ground cinnamon

1/2 vanilla bean (2g), split and scraped or 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Two 3- by 1-inch strips orange zest from 1 large orange

1/8 teaspoon kosher salt

7 tablespoons (88g) plain or toasted sugar, divided

5 large egg yolks (75g)

2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter","If using fresh bread, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 225°F (110°C). Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Using a bread knife, remove crusts from bread, then cut into four rectangular pieces that are 2 inches thick and about 1 1/2 inches wide and 4 inches long (the width and length of the pieces can be determined by the size of your loaf of bread; it's the thickness of the pieces that is most important). Arrange bread pieces on prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1 inch of space between each piece, and bake, flipping pieces over halfway through, until lightly toasted and dry on their surface, 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a heatproof surface to cool slightly, and increase oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). If using stale bread, you can skip the toasting step; cut the bread into pieces as described and preheat oven to 375°F.

Meanwhile, in a 2-quart saucier or saucepan, combine milk, cinnamon, vanilla, orange zest, and salt. Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until milk registers 190°F (88°C) on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside to steep for 30 minutes.

While the milk steeps, whisk together 1/4 cup (50g) sugar and egg yolks in a medium bowl until sugar is dissolved and mixture turns pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes. Set a fine-mesh strainer over bowl with egg mixture, and slowly pour one-third of milk mixture into yolk mixture to temper, whisking constantly to prevent yolks from curdling. Add remaining milk mixture, whisking constantly until well-combined; set aside but don't clean strainer; wipe out saucepan.

Add bread to custard base and soak, turning pieces occasionally to ensure they are coated on all sides, until fully saturated and soft (they should barely hold together, so handle with care), 5 to 6 minutes. Using a small spatula, carefully transfer bread pieces to a plate, allowing excess liquid to drip back into the bowl of custard base; set bread pieces aside.

Strain custard base through fine-mesh strainer into now-empty saucier; you should have between 3/4 to 1 cup (175 to 240ml) of liquid. Return to stovetop; once again set aside but don't clean strainer, and wipe out bowl. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to prevent egg yolks from curdling, until mixture registers 175°F (79.5°C) on an instant-read thermometer and thickens slightly so that it coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Working quickly, remove from heat and pour crème anglaise through fine-mesh strainer back into now-empty bowl. Place piece of plastic wrap directly on surface of crème anglaise to prevent skin from forming, and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a medium cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat until just foaming. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons (25g) sugar in an even layer over butter, then add bread pieces to skillet. Cook, carefully turning pieces occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven, and bake until bread pieces are heated through at the center, about 5 minutes.

Remove skillet from oven, and carefully flip bread pieces over so that bottom sides that were in contact with the pan are facing up. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon (13g) sugar evenly over bread pieces. If using a blowtorch, ignite torch and caramelize sugar by sweeping flame 2 inches above bread pieces, until sugar is bubbling and deep golden brown. If not using a blowtorch, simply serve with the sprinkled sugar on top.

Divide crème anglaise between individual serving plates, followed by bread pieces. Serve immediately.","French Toast,Spanish,Breakfast & Brunch,Easter,Mother's Day",https://www.seriouseats.com/torrijas-caramelizadas-spanish-french-toast

2 medium yellow onions (3/4 pound; 300g), finely diced

4 pork tenderloin medallions (1 pound; 450g total)

1/2 cup sofrito (4.5 ounces; 130g)

1/2 teaspoon sweet smoked Spanish paprika (pimentón dulce)

Pinch saffron threads

3 1/2 cups (830ml) boiling hot white chicken stock or low-sodium broth, vegetable stock, or water, plus more as needed

1 1/4 cups (9 ounces; 255g) short-grain Spanish rice, such as Bomba and Calasparra

6 large shelled shrimp (heads on, if desired)

Lemon wedges, for serving","For the Sofrito: Place dried peppers (if using) in a medium heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water (if not using, skip to Step 3). Place a weight or wet paper towel on top to help submerge the peppers. Let stand until peppers are fully softened, 30 minutes to 1 hour. If the peppers are very stubborn (as thick-skinned ñoras can be), you may need to tear a small hole in them to let water penetrate inside.

Drain peppers and discard stems and seeds. Using a paring knife, carefully scrape the flesh from the skins. Discard skins.

In a 3-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onion, red pepper, and scraped rehydrated chili flesh (if using), season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring, until vegetables have released their liquid and are beginning to brown lightly on the bottom of the pan, about 6 minutes.

Lower heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring and scraping frequently, until sofrito is sweet to the taste and a deep golden brown color, about 30 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes longer. You should have about 1 cup. You can refrigerate the sofrito in an airtight container for up to 5 days. (Any extra sofrito not used in this recipe can be used as a flavor base for soups, sauces, braises, stews, and more.)

For the Paella: In a 12- or 13-inch paella pan or straight-sided stainless steel sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.

Season chicken and pork all over with salt, then add to pan and cook, turning, until deeply browned on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer pork to a platter, leaving chicken in the pan.

Add sofrito, paprika, and saffron, and cook, stirring and scraping until well mixed and sizzling.

Add stock (or water) and bring to a rolling boil. Season lightly with salt. Sprinkle in rice all over, making sure all grains are submerged and none are stuck on top of the pieces of chicken. Using your spatula, gently swirl the liquid around to distribute the rice evenly. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.

Cook for 8 minutes without stirring, then return pork to the pan. Season shrimp with salt and nestle around the chicken thighs and pork pieces. Continue cooking until the rice is just al dente and the liquid has fully been absorbed, about 8 minutes longer; turn the shrimp during this time to cook them until pink on both sides. Reduce heat to low at any point to prevent scorching on bottom (though browned and crispy rice on the bottom is desirable). Make sure to observe the boiling pattern throughout cooking, and move the pan around to give heat to all areas.

If the liquid cooks off and the rice isn't done enough, add more boiling-hot stock or water in small additions and continue cooking until the rice reaches the desired doneness. You can also use a spoon to carefully dig into the paella and check the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing is burning.

When the rice is perfectly cooked and the liquid is fully absorbed, remove from heat and let rest 5 minutes before serving with lemon wedges.","Spanish,Stovetop Chicken,Stovetop Pork,Chicken Thighs,Pork",https://www.seriouseats.com/stovetop-paella-mixta-for-four-with-pork-chicken-and-shrimp

7 cups (1.65L) boiling hot white chicken stock or low-sodium broth, vegetable stock, or water, plus more as needed

2.5 cups (17 1/2 ounces; 495g) short-grain Spanish rice, such as Bomba and Calasparra

Lemon wedges, for serving","For the Sofrito: Place dried peppers (if using) in a medium heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water (if not using, skip to Step 3). Place a weight or wet paper towel on top to help submerge the peppers. Let stand until peppers are fully softened, 30 minutes to 1 hour. If the peppers are very stubborn (as thick-skinned ñoras can be), you may need to tear a small hole in them to let water penetrate inside.

Drain peppers and discard stems and seeds. Using a paring knife, carefully scrape the flesh from the skins. Discard skins.

In a 3-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onion, green pepper, red pepper, leek, and scraped rehydrated chili flesh (if using), season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring, until vegetables have released their liquid and are beginning to brown lightly on the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes.

Lower heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring and scraping frequently, until sofrito is sweet to the taste and a deep golden brown color, about 45 minutes longer. You should have about 2 cups. You can refrigerate the sofrito in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

For the Paella: Make sure your grill is on a level surface. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over the coal grate. Set cooking grate in place and set a 17-inch paella pan on top of that.

Add oil to paella pan, pushing it around with a long metal spatula (a stainless-steel wok spatula can work well here) to coat the entire surface, and heat until oil is lightly smoking.

Season chicken and pork all over with salt, then add to pan and cook, turning, until deeply browned on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer pork to a platter and leave chicken in the pan, pushing the chicken pieces to the outer edge.

Add tomato purée, sofrito, paprika, and saffron, and cook, stirring and scraping until tomato sauce is moderately browned, about 2 minutes.

Add stock (or water) and bring to a rolling boil. Season lightly with salt. Sprinkle in rice all over, making sure all grains are submerged and none are stuck on top of the pieces of chicken. Using your spatula, gently swirl the liquid around to distribute the rice evenly. Return to a boil and cook, without stirring, for 8 minutes. Return pork to the paella pan.

At this point, depending on the heat of your grill, you will likely want to raise the paella higher aloft to increase its distance from the heat source and lessen the chances that it burns below (unless your grill has gotten so tepid that the paella is barely simmering, you'll want to do this). To do it, lift the paella pan carefully off the grill and set either wadded-up aluminum foil or, for an even higher lift, bricks, on the grill grate (it helps to have another person aid you during this step).

Set the paella pan back on the grill and continue cooking until the rice is just al dente and the liquid has fully been absorbed, about 8 minutes longer; turn the pork once during this time to heat them through on both sides. If the liquid cooks off and the rice isn't done enough, add more boiling-hot stock or water in small additions until the rice reaches the desired doneness. You can also use a spoon to carefully dig into the paella and check the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing is burning.

When the rice is perfectly cooked and the liquid is fully absorbed, remove from heat and let rest 10 minutes before serving with lemon wedges.","Spanish,Grilling,Chicken Legs,Pork Loin,Rice & Grains",https://www.seriouseats.com/grilled-chicken-and-pork-paella

Kosher salt

1 1/2 teaspoons (7ml) sherry vinegar, plus more if desired

1 1/2 tablespoons (22ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish and for serving

Green seedless grapes, crushed toasted almonds, and thinly sliced fresh mint leaves, for garnish","In a blender, combine almonds with water and garlic and blend at high speed until milky; you may need to stop and scrape down sides of blender jar once or twice. Add bread and blend until very smooth. Season with salt, then blend in vinegar and olive oil. If using a less powerful blender, you may want to pass the soup through a fine-mesh strainer at this point; with a high-powered blender, that won't be necessary.

Transfer soup to a sealed container and refrigerate until very well chilled, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

To Serve: Cut up grapes into smaller pieces and toss with almonds, mint, and just enough olive oil to coat. Season garnish with salt. Shake or stir soup well. Check consistency and thin with cold water, if desired. Adjust seasoning, adding more salt and/or vinegar, if desired. Pour into chilled serving bowls.

Basque-Style Grilled Whole Turbot Recipe,Sasha Marx,East African Cuisines,"3 tablespoons (45ml) white wine vinegar

Kosher salt

1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil

1 (2- to 2 1/2 pound/ 1kg) whole turbot, gutted","In a medium bowl, whisk together vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon (2g) salt. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Alternatively, place ingredients in a tightly sealing jar, seal, and shake vigorously until emulsified. Transfer vinaigrette to a container with a pourable spout, ideally a squeeze bottle (if you own one), or a liquid measuring cup. Set aside.

About 30 minutes before grilling, remove turbot from refrigerator and let come to room temperature. Light 1 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate.

Thoroughly pat turbot dry with paper towels, and season dark-skin-side assertively with salt. Place turbot in grilling basket (if using), and set over hot side of grill, dark-skin-side down. Cook until skin begins to blister slightly, about 4 minutes. Season white-skin side with salt, then flip fish over.

Cook white-skin side until skin begins to blister slightly, about 4 minutes. While white-skin-side cooks, drizzle dark-skin side heavily with vinaigrette (using about 1/3 of it). Flip turbot back over, and cook dark-skin side until skin is well-blistered and flesh is opaque, about 4 minutes longer. While turbot cooks, drizzle white-skin side heavily with vinaigrette (again using about 1/3 of it). Remove turbot from grill and transfer to a large rimmed serving platter.

Drizzle remaining vinaigrette over turbot.


Carve turbot, reserving fins and head, and transfer fillets to serving plates; discard spine. Tilt serving platter towards you so that vinaigrette and juices from turbot pool at the bottom. Using a spoon, rapidly stir liquid as if whisking, until mixture thickens and emulsifies, 15 to 30 seconds. Spoon vinaigrette over fillets, and serve right away. For the adventurous, place serving platter in the center of the table, encouraging people to pick at the cheeks and meat from the head of the turbot, and to pick up the fins with their hands and eat the meat off the bone.","Seafood Mains,Spanish,Gluten-free Mains,Grilled Fish,Fish",https://www.seriouseats.com/basque-style-grilled-whole-turbot

1/4 cup (60ml) water

1 teaspoon pimentón dulce (sweet smoked Spanish paprika, see note)

2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves

2 to 4 crispy fried eggs (optional)","In a large cast iron skillet, combine olive oil, lightly salted pork belly, and garlic cloves and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and pork belly is crisp, about 8 minutes. Add chorizo and continue to cook until it's lightly browned and oil takes on a deep-orange hue, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork belly, chorizo, and garlic to a medium bowl and set aside; discard garlic.

Increase heat to medium-high and heat until shimmering. Add bell and Anaheim peppers to skillet, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until pepper skins are lightly blistered and browned, about 3 minutes. Add kale to skillet, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until kale is slightly wilted and softened, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to bowl with pork belly and chorizo. Set aside.

Add bread in an even layer to skillet, drizzle water over top, and cook, stirring frequently with metal spatula to evenly coat with oil mixture. Season with salt to taste, and continue to cook, stirring and breaking up bread into smaller pieces with spatula, while occasionally scraping bottom of the skillet to prevent bread from sticking and scorching. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping frequently, until mixture is broken down into small crumbs, 1- to 2-inch pieces, and bread is light golden brown and crisp but not hard, 15 to 20 minutes. If bread begins to get too dark, reduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle bread with additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed.

To finish, sprinkle migas with pimentón and stir until bread is evenly coated and mixture is aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add vegetable and chorizo mixture to skillet, stir to combine and season to taste with salt. Remove from heat. If serving with fried eggs, transfer migas to serving bowl and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Wipe out skillet and fry eggs. Divide migas into individual bowls, sprinkle with parsley, and top with fried eggs. Serve immediately.

Place pork chop between two 12-inch-square pieces of plastic wrap and gently pound pork to 1/4-inch thickness, using a meat pounder or the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet. Repeat with remaining cutlets. Season pork cutlets with salt and pepper.

Fill a wide, shallow bowl or high-rimmed plate with flour, a second bowl or plate with beaten eggs, and a third bowl or plate with panko.

Working with one cutlet at a time, dredge a cutlet in flour with your left hand, shaking off excess. Transfer to egg dish, then turn pork with your right hand to coat both sides. Lift with your right hand and allow excess egg to drain off, then transfer to bread crumbs. With your left hand, scoop bread crumbs on top of pork, then gently press, turning pork to ensure a good layer of crumbs on both sides.

1/2 ounce tap water (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)

5 1/2 ounces ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 1/4 cups; 155g)","Adjust oven rack to lower middle position, and preheat to 350°F. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine candi or toasted sugar with butter, baking soda, cinnamon, kinako, nutmeg, salt, cloves, cardamom, and anise. Cream on medium speed until fluffy, soft, and pale, about 10 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and paddle as needed if the sugar seems dense and compacted at the bottom of the bowl.

While creaming on medium speed, slowly splash in the water a little at a time. Once it disappears into the fluffy butter/sugar mix, reduce speed to low and add the flour all at once. Continue mixing until the dough begins to gather around the paddle.

Turn the dough onto a clean surface, and knead gently to form a ball. Pat into a rectangular shape, then dust with flour, above and below. Roll to a thickness of 3/16-inch, using a ruler for guidance. Slide an offset spatula beneath the dough to loosen, and brush away the excess flour.

With a fluted pastry wheel, cut the dough into 3/4-inch strips, then cut crossways to form 2-inch rectangles. With the offset spatula, transfer the cutouts and scraps to a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving an inch between each piece to account for spread.

Bake until cookies are golden brown, about 16 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through if needed to ensure even browning. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet; the cookies will not crisp until fully cool. Enjoy with coffee, and store leftovers in an airtight container up to 1 month at room temperature; the scraps can be ground to use for crumbs and frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months.","Cookies,Belgian,Pastries,Christmas Cookies",https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-biscoff-recipe

Herb Spätzle with Speck and Peas Recipe,Kumiko Mitarai,Eastern European Cuisines,"1 cup all-purpose flour

½ cup semolina flour

1 teaspoon Kosher salt, plus more for cooking water and final seasoning

1 teaspoon each finely minced fresh thyme, fresh sage

Large pinch freshly ground black pepper

2 eggs

1/3 – ½ cup milk

3-4 tablespoons unsalted butter

½ cup bread crumbs

1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

1 – 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil, such as grapeseed oil

2 ounces diced speck or bacon

½ cup cooked peas","In a mixing bowl, whisk together flours, salt, herbs, and pepper. Beat eggs lightly with 1/3 cup milk and add to dry ingredients. Using a fork, quickly and gently combine wet and dry ingredients. If dough is very thick and difficult to work together, add more milk, up to 1⁄2 cup in total. Allow dough to rest for about 15 minutes.

In the meanwhile, prepare a large pot of salted boiling water. Moisten a wooden cutting board with cool water. Spread a portion of the batter in a long strip along the board.

Use a large offset spatula to cut off small, thin strips of the batter and drop them into salted, boiling water. Cut the dough at small angles to keep the spätzle from getting too long. As you cut the dough, let the small bits drop into the boiling water. Once the spätzle floats, let them cook at a gentle boil for another 1-2 minutes, until they no longer have a raw flour taste and have a pleasantly firm texture.

Remove the cooked spätzle with a strainer and shock briefly in ice water. Drain the cooled spätzle well and spread on a baking sheet to dry further while you continue cutting and cooking remaining dough.

Heat a skillet over medium heat, melt one tablespoon of butter and add bread crumbs and parsley. Toss to coat evenly and cook until lightly toasted and crisp. Transfer bread crumbs out of pan and set aside.

Add a small amount of cooking oil (a little more if speck is very lean) to the skillet. Cook speck or bacon until fat is rendered and meat is crispy. Add peas and remaining 2-3 tablespoons of butter. When butter is melted, add spätzle. Cook until spätzle is heated through and slightly browned in some spots. Season with additional salt, to taste.

1 (14.5-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped

3/4 cup cider vinegar

1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar","Cut off and discard both ends of each eggplant, and cut them lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Lay the slices out on a baking sheet, and sprinkle both sides with the 3 tablespoons salt. Set aside for 20 minutes so that the salt will draw out some of the water from the eggplant. Then pat the eggplant dry with a dish towel.

Put the olive oil, garlic, scallions, parsley, cayenne, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor, and puree until a smooth paste forms (it will resemble pesto). Spread liberally all over both sides of the eggplant slices.

In a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons canola oil. Add enough eggplant slices to cover the bottom of the pan, and cook until they are browned on both sides and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the eggplant to a platter or plate. Repeat this process with the remaining eggplant slices, adding 2 tablespoons oil for each batch. Cut the cooked eggplant into 1-inch-wide strips.

Add one Tablespoon sugar and two cups of flour. Mix until consistency of pancake batter then cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to allow yeast to activate. Let rest for 30 minutes or until starter is very bubbly.

In a medium bowl combine egg and yolks. Whisk until light and frothy, about 4 minutes. Whisk in 1/2 cup sugar, salt and vanilla.

Slowly stir cooled melted butter into yeast starter until combined. Then slowly incorporate egg mixture until just combined. Fit mixer with dough hook. Stir in flour, working 1/2 a cup in at a time until a soft dough comes together. Note: this dough is very sticky.

Spray a large bowl with cooking spray and transfer dough to bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise until double in size. About an hour.

Turn out dough on a very generously floured surface. Dust surface of dough with flour then punch down dough to about half an inch high. Using a floured two- or three-inch biscuit cutter, cut out doughnuts. Carefully transfer doughnut rounds to parchment lined baking sheets. Cover sheets with a clean dish towel and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.

Pour canola oil into a large dutch oven to a depth of 2 inches. Heat oil to 360°F. Once oil reaches the proper temperature use a heat resistant spatula or shallow strainer to carefully drop doughnuts in, one at a time, cooking a maximum of 3 at once. Cook doughnuts until a warm, deep brown on one side, then using heat resistance tongs turn the doughnut and cook the other side until it reaches the same degree of doneness. Remove from oil letting any excess oil drain off then transfer to a wire rack for cooling. Test your first doughnut to make sure that the insides are completely cooked, if not adjust your cooking time accordingly. Let doughnut cool.

Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spinach and cook, stirring often, until any remaining water has evaporated. Add all 4 cheeses, artichokes, salt and pepper, and nutmeg and stir until well-combined and completely melted. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out to a sheet about 1/16-inch thick. Using a 3-inch circular cookie cutter or the top of a glass, cut the dough into circles. Roll the excess dough into a new dough ball and wrap with plastic wrap; let rest for 5 minutes, then roll out and repeat. Discard any remaining dough scraps.

Place 2 teaspoons of filling in the center of each dough round. Working one at a time, use a wet finger to moisten the edge of each round with water, then fold into a semi-circle around the filling. Gently pinch edge together to seal, then press with tines of fork to make pleated edge. At this point, the pierogi can be frozen and saved for later use, if desired (to freeze, arrange pierogi on parchment-lined baking sheets and freeze, then transfer to zipper-lock bags and return to freezer until ready to use).

Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil and add fresh or frozen pierogi in small batches. Boil until they float to the surface and are cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and let drain in a colander. Repeat until all of the pierogi have been boiled.

1 tablespoon (15ml) red wine or sherry vinegar, plus more if desired

1/2 cup skinned and toasted almonds and/or hazelnuts (2 3/4 ounces; 80g); see note

2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if desired

Kosher salt","Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place tomatoes and half of the garlic head on it. Roast in the oven until tomatoes are wrinkled and lightly charred in spots and garlic is soft, about 1 hour. Let cool.

Meanwhile, place dried peppers in a medium heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Place a weight or wet paper towel on top to help submerge the peppers. Let stand until peppers are fully softened, 30 minutes to 1 hour. If the peppers are very stubborn (as thick-skinned ñoras can be), you may need to tear a small hole in them to let water penetrate inside.

Drain peppers and discard stems and seeds. Using a paring knife, carefully scrape the flesh from the skins. Discard skins. Peel skins from tomatoes and roasted garlic.

To Make the Sauce Using a Mortar and Pestle: Add 3 cloves roasted garlic and 1 or 2 cloves skinned raw garlic to the mortar. (Feel free to make this recipe more or less garlicky, according to your own tastes, by adding or subtracting roasted or raw garlic.) Smash garlic to a paste with the pestle.

Add bread and moisten with vinegar. Smash to a paste. Add nuts and smash as finely as you can. The mixture should have the consistency of a rough paste when you're done.

Smash in the scraped pepper flesh, followed by the skinned roasted tomatoes. Mix in olive oil until thoroughly combined. Season with salt. Add more oil, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, if a thinner, richer sauce is desired. Add more vinegar to taste as well.

To Make the Sauce Using a Countertop Blender or Immersion Blender: Add 3 cloves roasted garlic and 2 cloves skinned raw garlic to the jar of a blender, or blending container if using an immersion blender.

Blend in skinned roasted tomatoes and scraped pepper flesh. Add bread, olive oil, and vinegar, and blend until smooth. (How smooth to make it is up to you; some texture is okay.) Season with salt and add more oil and vinegar to taste, if desired.

To Make the Sauce Using a Food Processor: In the bowl of a food processor, combine 3 cloves roasted garlic and 2 cloves skinned raw garlic (use more or less roasted and raw garlic, as desired, according to your own tastes), along with bread and nuts. Process, scraping down sides as necessary, until finely chopped.

Add skinned roasted tomatoes and scraped pepper flesh and process until a thick, rough paste forms. Process in olive oil and vinegar, then season with salt.

Tortilla Española (Spanish Egg and Potato Omelette) Recipe,Daniel Gritzer,Eastern European Cuisines,"8 large eggs

Kosher salt

2 cups (475ml) extra-virgin olive oil (see note)

1 1/2 pounds (700g) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced crosswise

3/4 pound (350g) yellow onions, thinly sliced

Allioli, for serving","In a large bowl, beat eggs vigorously with a large pinch of salt until frothy. Set aside.

Meanwhile, in a 10-inch nonstick or well-seasoned carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add potatoes and onions; they should gently (but not vigorously) bubble in the oil. Regulating heat to maintain a gentle bubbling, cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes and onions are meltingly tender, about 25 minutes. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a heatproof bowl and drain potatoes and onions of excess oil. Reserve oil.

Transfer potatoes and onions to a medium heatproof bowl and season generously with salt, stirring well to combine. Beat eggs vigorously to re-froth, then scrape potato and onion in and stir until thoroughly combined. Set aside for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, wipe out skillet. Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) reserved frying oil to skillet and set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Scrape egg mixture into skillet and cook, swirling and shaking pan rapidly, until bottom and sides begin to set, about 3 minutes. Using a heatproof spatula, press the edges in to begin to form the tortilla's puck shape. Continue to cook, adjusting heat to prevent bottom of tortilla from burning, until beginning to set around edges, about 3 minutes longer.

Working over a sink or garbage can, place a large overturned flat plate or lid on top of skillet, set hand on top (using a dish towel if you are sensitive to heat), and, in one very quick motion, invert tortilla onto it. Add 1 more tablespoon (15ml) reserved oil to skillet and return to heat. Carefully slide tortilla back into skillet and continue to cook until second side is beginning to firm up, about 2 minutes. Use rubber spatula to again press the sides in all around to form a rounded puck shape. Continue to cook tortilla until lightly browned on second side but still tender in the center when pressed with a finger, about 2 minutes longer. If desired, you can flip tortilla 2 to 3 more times during these last minutes of cooking, which helps to cook the center more evenly and reinforce the shape.

Carefully slide tortilla out of skillet onto a clean plate (or invert it onto a clean plate using same method as before) and let stand at least 5 minutes before serving with allioli. Tortilla can be cut into wedges for a larger meal or into cubes for an hors d'oeuvre–sized snack. It is just as good, if not better, at room temperature. Leftover tortilla can be refrigerated up to 3 days; allow to return to room temperature before serving. Remaining frying oil can be used in other dishes; it has an excellent flavor thanks to the long cooking with potato and onion.","Spanish,Dairy-free Snacks & Appetizers,Vegetarian Snacks & Appetizers,Omelettes,Yukon Gold Potatoes",https://www.seriouseats.com/tortilla-espanola-spanish-potato-omelette-recipe

1 lb (455 g) meaty veal or beef bones

1 medium carrot, trimmed and peeled

1 medium parsnip, trimmed and peeled

1 large onion, peeled and halved

1 leek (white and green parts), trimmed, halved lengthwise, and rinsed

1/4 celery root, peeled, or 1 long celery stalk

3 to 4 dried mushrooms or porcini, if you’ve got them

8 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole, plus 2 extra just in case

1 bay leaf

1 large pinch of dried marjoram, plus more for seasoning

6 peppercorns (optional; throw them in if you like a spicier soup)

About 12 cups (2.8 L) water (depending on the size of the pot)

Juice of 1 lemon

Salt and freshly ground pepper

1/2 cup (120 ml) sour cream or plain Greek-style yogurt (optional)","Combine the beets, bones, carrot, parsnip, onion, leek, celery root, mushrooms, 8 garlic cloves, the bay leaf, marjoram, peppercorns (if using), and water in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. (There should be enough water to cover the other ingredients.) Remove any foam that has risen to the top, cover, and turn down the heat. Simmer gently until the meat falls off the bones and the vegetables are very soft, about 2 hours.

Strain the soup through a colander, pressing the solids to extract all the liquids. Taste: If it is too watery, then boil down, uncovered, for an additional 30 minutes or so. If it seems too dense, add water. When the soup is ready, stir in the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and, if you like, some more dried marjoram.

You might also ask yourself at this point whether the soup needs even more garlic, in which case peel a couple more cloves, crush them with a garlic press or the flat side of a knife, toss them in, and simmer for a minute or two. Make sure they don’t fall into anyone’s bowl when you serve (unless, like Anne, the person happens to like boiled garlic cloves). The flavor should be slightly sour and garlicky, yet with that beety hint of sweetness.

Serve clear, very hot, in small bowls or even large teacups, which you can pick up and drink. If you prefer yours bright pink, then serve in large soup plates with a spoonful of the sour cream or plain yogurt dropped into each one. This keeps in the refrigerator (covered) for days, and indeed grows slightly tangier with time, which is how it is supposed to be.","Beets,Polish,Stovetop Vegetables,Soups",https://www.seriouseats.com/from-a-polish-country-house-kitchens-barszcz

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup arborio rice

4 cups whole milk

1/3 cup light brown sugar

1/3 cup granulated sugar

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

4 large eggs

For the Crust

1/4 cup warm water

2 teaspoons instant yeast

1/4 cup sugar, plus 1 teaspoon

2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting surface

1/4 teaspoon salt

2 large Eggs, separated into whites and yolks

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Non-stick cooking spray","In a small saucepan combine prunes, raisins, 1/4 cup brandy, sugar and water, stirring to dissolve sugar then bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat. Reduce to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until a thick syrup forms, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a food processor. Add remaining brandy and process until you have a thick paste. Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate covered.

In a medium saucepan combine 1 1/2 cups of water with the salt. Bring to a boil then add the rice. Cover then reduce heat to medium low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is soft and water has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Stir in milk, sugars, cinnamon, and vanilla. Simmer stirring frequently until rice is very soft, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat.

Whisk together eggs until smooth, then, while whisking constantly, add the hot milk mixture to the eggs, 1 tablespoon at a time until half of it has been incorporated. Whisking constantly, slowly incorporate the egg/milk mixture back into the pot. Return mixture to heat and cook until the pudding thickens, 3 to 4 more minutes, then remove from heat, transfer to a medium bowl, cover and refrigerate to cool.

While filling is chilling prepare the dough. In a medium bowl add warm water (about 110 to 115°F) and yeast. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of sugar and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm place warm for 5 minutes to activate the yeast. At the end of this time the yeast should be foamy. In a medium bowl whisk together flour and salt and set aside.

In the bowl of an electric stand mixer beat the egg whites on high until stiff peaks form. Add yolks and continue beating until mixture is a pale yellow then add remaining sugar and butter beating until thoroughly combined. Stir in activated yeast mixture until just incorporated then stir in flour mixture. The dough will be soft and sticky. Turn out onto a generously floured surface and sprinkle with flour then knead lightly for about a minute. Transfer to a large bowl coated in cooking spray or a neutral oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise until dough has doubled, about 1 hour. While dough rises, set oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.

Once dough has risen, remove from bowl, punch it down and roll it out into a large circle (about 13' in diameter) and place into a 9 inch pie dish. Cover with a clean dish towel and let rise for 10 minutes, then spread prune filling on the bottom. Stir chilled rice pudding to get rid of any skin, then pour into the pie shell and layer on top of prune filling. Bake until crust is golden and center is set, 40 to 45 minutes. Ff crust begins to brown too much you can carefully cover with aluminum foil or use a pie shield. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes then transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely.

"From a Polish Country House Kitchen's Pierogi with Potato, Cheese, Bacon, and Peas Filling",Kate Williams,Eastern European Cuisines,"Pierogi Dough

3 cups (390 g) all-purpose flour, plus additional for kneading

1 large egg

2 teaspoons vegetable oil

1 teaspoon salt, plus more for the boiling water

1/2 to 3/4 cup (120 to 180 ml) warm water

&nbsp

Filling

2 medium potatoes (white, baking, or Yukon gold—whatever you prefer), peeled and cut into chunks

6 strips bacon

3 large onions, peeled—1 minced and 2 sliced

1 cup (130 g) frozen baby peas, defrosted

9 oz (255 g) ricotta cheese

Salt and freshly ground pepper

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed

1 to 2 cups/240 to 480 ml light sour cream (optional)","For the pierogi dough: On a clean work surface, mound the flour and make a well in the center. Add the egg, vegetable oil, and salt to the well and carefully beat together with a fork without incorporating the flour. Continue stirring with a wooden spoon, adding small amounts of the warm water, and gradually incorporating the flour. Only add the next bit of water when the last has been thoroughly blended with the flour and the mixture has become dry. Once the dough has begun to form, lose the spoon and knead the dough with your hands. Stop adding water once all the flour has been incorporated and a soft dough has formed (it should not feel wet or sticky—if it does, add a little more flour).

Grab a kitchen timer and set it for 8 minutes. Continue to knead the dough until the timer goes off, dusting the work surface with flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. It should be smooth and elastic. Invert a bowl over the dough and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour.

For the filling: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan filled with water, bring to a boil, and continue boiling until soft. Drain and place in a large mixing bowl.

While the potatoes are cooking, fry the bacon in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until crispy. Remove the cooked bacon and drain on paper towels, but keep 1 or 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pan. Add the minced onion and cook in the bacon fat until it is soft and lightly browned. Add the peas and continue to cook until the peas are just cooked, about 2 minutes. Set aside.

Crumble the bacon and add it to the bowl with the potatoes, along with the cheese. Season generously with salt and pepper, and mash the ingredients together. We use a hand mixer set at a low speed. You can use a food processor if you wish, but be careful not to overprocess: The mixture should be somewhat lumpy—not creamy smooth. Fold in the peas and minced onions. Taste and correct for seasoning.

To fill and cook the pierogi: Bring a large pot of salted to water to a boil.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface until about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. Cut circles 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) in diameter with either the rim of a glass or a cookie cutter. Spoon about 1 tbsp of filling in the center of each one, and fold the dough over the filling to make a half circle. (Don’t overfill, or the pierogi will become difficult to seal.) Crimp the edges with your fingers or the tines of a fork so they are well sealed (dampen the edges first if necessary).

Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in the same frying pan you used for the minced onion. Cook the sliced onions until soft and brown. Do not cook them too quickly; this should take 20 minutes or so. Reduce the heat to low if necessary. When done, set aside and keep them warm. You can cover them with foil and place in a warming oven, or an oven set on low heat.

Boil the pierogi in batches, for 5 minutes after they have floated to the surface of the water. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and set aside on a large plate or platter.

In a large frying pan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat and lightly brown the cooked pierogi in batches—as many as will fit in the pan without crowding, turning once and adding more butter to the pan if necessary between batches. Transfer to a warm platter. Pour the cooked onions over the tops of the fried pierogi and serve with a bowl of the sour cream on the side for those who would like to dollop some of that on, too.","Polish,Stovetop,Ricotta,Bacon,Onions",https://www.seriouseats.com/from-a-polish-country-house-kitchens-pierogi

Heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil over medium heat in a stew pot large enough to hold all the meat and vegetables. Cook the onion until softened, remove with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Add the remaining 2 tbsp oil to the pot and lightly brown the meat, in batches, over medium heat, 2 to 3 minutes per side, transferring the meat to a plate when it’s done.

When all the meat has been browned, raise the heat to high, pour in the wine, and boil briefly, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Return the meat and all its resting juices back to the pot, and add the onion, kielbasa, prunes, cabbage, and the sauerkraut and bacon mixture, along with its cooking water. Salt generously, add several grinds of pepper, and bring to a boil.

Turn down the heat, cover the pot with the lid slightly askew, and simmer on very low heat for a good 2 to 3 hours, until the meat falls apart and the broth is rich and brown. Stir the stew occasionally, and ensure that the liquid isn’t evaporating too quickly (add a small amount of water when necessary). Some like a watery bigos, but we find the tastiest outcome is for the sauerkraut, cabbage, and meat all to be practically melted together, with enough sauce to keep everything moist, but not so much that any of the ingredients float, as in a more traditional stew.

Serve in a large casserole with a big spoon and thick slices of dark peasant bread. You’ll of course need utensils, but the fun of it is to shovel the bigos and its juices on to the bread. Bigos lasts forever, and gets better with time. One of Anne’s friends routinely makes this on Wednesday to serve on Saturday night, and swears that it improves every day.","Braised & Stewed Beef,Polish,Beef Chuck,Other Meat & Poultry",https://www.seriouseats.com/from-a-polish-country-house-kitchens-hunters

5 large eggs

1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 120ml) fresh lemon juice

Kosher salt

Minced dill, for garnish","In a 3-quart saucepan, combine chicken breast halves with chicken stock. Heat gently, using an instant-read thermometer to keep the temperature of the stock around 150°F (65°C). Cook until the chicken breast reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C), about 1 hour, then remove from stock.

When chicken is cool enough to handle, dice or shred the meat and set aside.

Add rice or orzo to stock and cook until just tender, about 20 minutes for rice and 13 minutes for orzo. Lower heat to a bare simmer.

Meanwhile, in a heatproof bowl, combine eggs with 1/4 cup (60ml) lemon juice and beat until lightly foamy.

While whisking constantly, ladle in about 1/2 cup of the hot chicken broth into the eggs (it's okay if some rice or orzo comes along for the ride). Ladle in a three or four more 1/2-cup additions of the hot chicken broth while whisking, then whisk the egg-broth mixture back into the broth in the saucepan. Season with salt.

Cook the chicken soup over low heat, whisking and scraping the sides constantly, until thickened by the eggs. Taste soup, then, if desired, whisk in remaining lemon juice until your desired level of lemon flavor is reached. Season with salt again, if needed.

Add chicken meat, then ladle into bowls. Garnish with dill and serve.","Greek,Stovetop Chicken,Chicken,Lemon,White Rice",https://www.seriouseats.com/avgolemono-soup-greek-lemon-egg-chicken-soup

2 large shallots (about 3 ounces; 90g), thinly sliced

Kosher salt

One (24.5-ounce; 700g) bottle tomato passata (see note)

4 ounces (1/2 cup; 115g) 'nduja (see note)

1 pound (450g) dried ziti, candele (broken into 3-inch pieces) or other short tubular pasta

2 ounces (60g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese","In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until shallots are softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes.

Add passata, and make sure to use up all of the tomato in the bottle by adding 1/4 cup (60ml) water to the empty bottle, screwing on the lid, shaking the contents, and then adding tomato-water mixture to the skillet.
